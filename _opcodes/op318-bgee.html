The creature type specified by the 'Type' field becomes immune to the spell or item specified in the 'Resource' field. See <a href="#op324">opcode #324</a> for more information.

{% capture note %}
This opcode can block EFF files too.<br/>
In order to do so, both the "Resource" field of op#318 and the "Parent resource" field (located at offset 0x94) of the EFF file must be the same string (max. 8 character long). Unlike <a href="#op206">opcode #206</a>, this one can innately block any type of resource (None/Spell/Item).
