<br/>Known values for 'Spellstate' are defined in <a href="../files/ids/bgee/splstate.htm">SPLSTATE.IDS</a>.
<br/>'Row#' selects the blocked spell or effect, the blocking criteria are listed in <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/7eyes.htm">7EYES.2DA</a> thus works like a very selective spell trap.
<br/>'Eye Group' may be used to define separate eye groups (it will remove 336 opcodes of the same type).

{% capture note %}
Effect is not applied if target already has specified 'Spellstate' set.
