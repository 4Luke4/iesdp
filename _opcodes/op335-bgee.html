This effect sets spellstate 'State', increases the seven eyes stat and grants special ability named in the resource field.
<br/>'Type' selects the blocked spell or effect, the blocking criteria are listed in 7eyes.2da thus works like a very selective spell trap.
<br/>'Eye Group' may be used to define separate eye groups (it will remove 336 opcodes of the same type).
