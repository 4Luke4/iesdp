Gives the targeted creature(s) immunity from the spell specified in the resource key. The strref specified by the 'String Reference' field is displayed when the spell is absorbed.

{% capture note %}
At least in EEs, this opcode can block EFF files too.<br/>
In order to do so, both the "Resource" field of op#206 and the "Parent resource" field (located at offset 0x94) of the EFF file must be the same string (max. 8 character long); moreover, you must set the "Resource type" field (located at offset 0x90) of the EFF file to 1 (Spell).
