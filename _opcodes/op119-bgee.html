Applies <a href="#op159">opcode 159</a> with a 'Parameter1' = 2 + ('Caster Level of the spell containing op119' / 3).<br />
In particular:
<ul>
	<li>A Wizard spell with op119 will use the caster's Wizard Casting Level.</li>
	<li>A Priest spell with op119 will use the caster's Priest Casting Level.</li>
	<li>An Innate spell with op119 will use the caster's Innate Casting Level.</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
A side note about non-spellcaster classes:<br /><br />

A Mirror Image scroll used by a Thief with HLA Use Any Item will use the level 10 duration, but the level 1 Image count.<br />
The scroll casts the spell at level 10, but the opcode checks the caster's Wizard Caster Level (which for a Thief is 1).
