<br/>0  Summon amount equal to ('Count' + Dice rolls)

{% capture note %}
As far as the 'Allegiance' of the summoned creatures is concerned, this opcode uses "Match Target", which sets the summoned creature's allegiance to one of 4|Ally, 128|Neutral, or 255|Enemy, based on the summoner (whichever group the summoner belongs to).
