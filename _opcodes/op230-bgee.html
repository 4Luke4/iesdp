{% capture note %}
Basically it removes one equipped resource effect list and one non-equipped resource effect list, except that equipped effects aren't removable while its item is equipped, so this behavior is not common.
The only way to really see this behavior (removing two separate resources) is to have a spell or item ability that only applies equipped effects.

{% capture note %}
Effects with a 'Power Level' of 0 are completely ignored by this opcode.
