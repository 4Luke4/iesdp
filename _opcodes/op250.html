Applies the 'Damage Modifier' value to the damage caused by the targetted creature(s). The effect works as a minimum damage value, i.e. at least 'Damage Modifier' damage will always be caused (on a successful hit).

{% capture note %}
This opcode works in the same manner as luck (and stacks with it), except that it only affects base weapon damage. It can be positive or negative.
