Applies the pause effect to the targeted creature(s).<br/>
In particular:
<ul>
	<li>Their inventory is still access-able.</li>
	<li>They are still select-able, and can be issued orders (for instance, activating modal abilities), though not all actions can be taken.</li>
	<li>It does not interrupt/end modal abilities the creature is currently using.</li>
	<li>They are not "helpless", an attack roll is still required to hit them.</li>
	<li>Their scripts stop running.</li>
</ul>

<br/>This effect sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#70">STAT #70</a> to 1.
