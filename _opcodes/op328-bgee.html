Sets the state of the targetted creature(s) to the value specified by the 'Type' field.
<br/>These effects could be detected by the gamescript trigger ExtendedStateCheck. (see extstate.ids).
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<br/>0   Chaotic Command
<br/>1   Miscast Magic
<br/>2   Pain
<br/>3   Greater Malison
<br/>4   Blood Rage
<br/>5   Cats Grace
<br/>6   Mold Touch
<br/>7   Shroud of Flame
<br/>If 'Mode' was set to 1, then this effect behaves like IWD2 Set State effect. (see splstate.ids)
