Displays a twin VVC or BAM linked to the target.<br/>
Known values for 'Sequence' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 => None</li>
	<li>1 => A</li>
	<li>2 => B</li>
	<li>3 => C</li>
	<li>4 => D</li>
	<li>5 => E</li>
	<li>6 => F</li>
	<li>7 => G</li>
</ul>
<br/>

'Eye Group' is related to <a href="op335-bgee.html">opcode #335</a>.<br/>
The two animations that are played must be named in the following way:
<ol>
	<li>'Resource'1'Sequence'.'extension'</li>
	<li>'Resource'2'Sequence'.'extension'</li>
</ol>
where 'Resource' is what you need to put in the resource field of this effect.<br/>
For instance, in IWD:EE we have:
<pre>
	#7eyes1a.VVC
	#7eyes1b.VVC
	#7eyes1c.VVC
	#7eyes1d.VVC
	#7eyes1e.VVC
	#7eyes1f.VVC
	#7eyes1g.VVC
	#7eyes2a.VVC
	#7eyes2b.VVC
	#7eyes2c.VVC
	#7eyes2d.VVC
	#7eyes2e.VVC
	#7eyes2f.VVC
	#7eyes2g.VVC
</pre>

Effect terminates when 'Sequence' = 0.
