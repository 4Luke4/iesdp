Displays 2 visual animations (VVC or BAM) similar to <a href="../_opcodes/op215.html">opcode #215</a> though only attached to a creature, not at a location (unattached). The animation filename is built from the 'resref' specified by the resource field and 'Sequence'.<br/>
Known values for 'Sequence' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 => None</li>
	<li>1 => A</li>
	<li>2 => B</li>
	<li>3 => C</li>
	<li>4 => D</li>
	<li>5 => E</li>
	<li>6 => F</li>
	<li>7 => G</li>
	<li> ... </li>
	<li>26 => Z</li>
</ul>
<br/>

The two animations that are played must be named in the following way:
<ol>
	<li>'Resource'1'Sequence'.'extension'</li>
	<li>'Resource'2'Sequence'.'extension'</li>
</ol>
For instance, in IWD:EE we have:
<ul>
	<li>#7eyes1a.VVC, #7eyes1b.VVC, #7eyes1c.VVC, #7eyes1d.VVC, #7eyes1e.VVC, #7eyes1f.VVC</li>
	<li>#7eyes2a.VVC, #7eyes2b.VVC, #7eyes2c.VVC, #7eyes2d.VVC, #7eyes2e.VVC, #7eyes2f.VVC</li>
</ul>
<br/>

Whenever an <a href="../_opcodes/op335-bgee.html">opcode #335</a> effect with a matching 'Eye Group' (parameter2 for op#336, special field for op#335) terminates on the creature, the 'Sequence' value is reduced by 1, until it reaches 0 and terminates itself.
