This effect stores information in a Projected Image/Simulacrum. The type can be accessed via CheckStat, stat PUPPETMASTERTYPE. Applying this effect to a non-image creature will set that creature to behave as an image (e.g. image casting, invisibility and talking behaviour).
<br/>Known values for 'ID Number' are:
<br/>1  Mislead
<br/>2  Project Image
<br/>3  Simulacrum
<br/>The 'Master ID' field stores a value (0-5) representing the owning party member.
