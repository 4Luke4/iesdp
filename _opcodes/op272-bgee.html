Applies the <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> specified by the resource key to the targeted creature(s) as specified by the 'Type' field.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 => Apply once per second ('Amount_2' and 'Frequency Multiplier' are ignored – 'Amount_1' needs to be non-zero)</li>
	<li>1 => Unknown (see below for further details)</li>
	<li>2 => Apply 'Amount_1' times every 'Frequency Multiplier' second(s)</li>
	<li>3 => Apply once every 'Amount_1' * 'Frequency Multiplier' second(s)</li>
	<li>4 => Apply 'Amount_2' times every 'Amount_1' * 'Frequency Multiplier' second(s) – This is the only one that must be in external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> files</li>
	<li>5+ => Crash</li>
</ul>

'Icon' defines the index from <a href="../files/2da/2da_bgee/statdesc.htm">STATDESC.2DA</a> for custom portrait icons. Default value is none (no icon).
<br/>

{% capture note %}
The timings are relative to the movement rate of the affected creature(s). <a href="#op40">opcode #40</a> (Slow) and <a href="#op78">opcode #78</a> (Disease) doubles the timing rate, effect <a href="#op16">opcode #16</a> (Haste) halves the timing rate.
{% endcapture %}

{% include info.html %}

{% capture note %}
This opcode does not have any function when 'Type' = 1, thought the effect is still present (it doesn't just instantly terminate), and will generate a portrait icon if 'Icon' is non-zero.
{% endcapture %}

{% include important.html %}

{% capture note %}
If 'Frequency Multiplier' = 0, its value is treated as 1. This is the default value for SPL/ITM effects.
