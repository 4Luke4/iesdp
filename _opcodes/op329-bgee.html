Applies the slow poison effect to the targeted creature(s), using the 'Slow Factor' field.

{% capture note %}
This opcode writes over the 'Frequency Multiplier' field of any <a href="#op25">opcode #25</a> effects on the targeted creature. As a result, it is useless against <a href="#op25">opcode #25</a> whose 'Type'=(0 or 1), as well as any <a href="#op25">Poison effect</a> that is used through <a href="#op177">opcode #177</a>, as 'Type' = 4 requires.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html %}

{% capture note %}
It can also accelerate <a href="#op25">Poisons</a> if their 'Frequency Multiplier' field was already higher than the value specified in <a href="#op329">opcode #329</a>.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html %}

{% capture note %}
It does not alter the duration of the <a href="#op25">poison</a>, nor does it affect any of the other frequency opcodes (<a href="#op78">78</a>/<a href="#op98">98</a>/<a href="#op272">272</a>).
