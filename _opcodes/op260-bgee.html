Activates a spell sequencer at a target point.<br/>
Activates any <a href="#op256">opcode #256</a> with a matching resource ('Activation Key') of the targeted creature(s).<br/>

When used in combination with <a href="#op257">opcode #257</a> (Spell Sequencer Creation):

<ul>
	<li>The resource key must be set to the filename of the spell which contains the Spell Sequencer Creation effect.</li>
	<li>The spell which contains the Spell Sequencer Creation effect can have a maximum filename of 7 characters.</li>
	<li>The spell which contains the Spell Sequencer Activation effect must have the same filename, suffixed with the P character, and should be an innate ability. For instance:
		<ul>
			<li>Spell Sequencer Creation filename = SPWI420</li>
			<li>Spell Sequencer Activation filename = SPWI420P</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<br/>

Those spells are cast by the targeted creature(s) at "this" ability's target.<br/>
For each stored spell, "this" ability's target must be within range of that spell, or it will fail.
<br/><br/>

All <a href="#op256">opcode #256</a> effects with a matching 'Activation Key' are removed if their 'Parameter3' = 1 (those created by <a href="#op257">opcode #257</a> / <a href="#op234">opcode #234</a> have this value set to '1' by default).

{% capture note %}
'Activation Key' does not have to reference an actual spell or item resource, it can be any valid string, so long as the effects involved (<a href="#op256">256</a>/<a href="#op257">257</a> and <a href="#op258">258</a>/<a href="#op260">260</a>) use the exact same string.
