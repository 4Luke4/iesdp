When a creature with this effect applied to it dies, the Protagonist enacts the damage animation, loses 1 Constitution point, and has their HP modified as dictated by the 'HP Modifier' field.
<br/>If 'HP Modifier' is positive, Maximum and Current HP are increased by 'HP Modifier' (though the message ' - was immune to my damage' is displayed).
<br/>If 'HP Modifier' is negative, Maximum HP is lowered by 'HP Modifier', and Current HP is lowered by twice 'HP Modifier'.
