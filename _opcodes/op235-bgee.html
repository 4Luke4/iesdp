Applies the wing buffet effect centred on the casting creature(s), buffeting the targeted creature(s) at the speed specified by the 'Speed' field, in the direction specified by the 'Direction' field. 'Speed' ranges from 0 to 255.
<br/>Known values for 'Direction' are:
<ul>
	<li>0/1 => Away from the destination point (specified in EFF file)</li>
	<li>2 => Away from the source</li>
	<li>3 => Towards the destination point (specified in EFF file)</li>
	<li>4 => Towards source</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
If used on creatures with the "pass-wall" effect applied, creatures can cross points marked as light obstacles on the search map.<br/>
In EEs, this effect can push creatures through closed (and locked) doors. (this does not require the "pass-wall" effect).

{% capture note %}
'Direction' options 1 and 3 "can" be overriden in external EFF files, but default to the ability target/location.
