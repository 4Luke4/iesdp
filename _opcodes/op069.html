Applies the non-detection effect to the targeted creature(s), setting STATE_NONDETECTION while active. This effect is negated by effect #70 Cure: Non-Detection. While in the non-detection state, the creature is immune to effects #47: Cure Invisibility and #116: Remove invisibilty, though they are affected by effects that remove illusionary protections by school or secondary type.
