Smoketest:

DLG 1.0 > Header
It is not mentioned that, for BG2 at least, offset 0x0030 contains the pause-control bits. They are nonexistant in BG1. Though WeiDU will, without being asked, create this flag when it compiles a dialog, the state index points past it to the start of the state table (0x0034), so BG1 doesn't even know it's there. Otherwise the game would likely crash, as the first state's strref normally sits at that offset in BG1.

DLG 1.0 > Transition Table > Flags 0x0000:
  Bit 4, when set to 1, notifies the user that the journal is being updated.
  Bit 7, when set to 1, causes the specified text to be added to the Journal section of the player journal.






Update for Icewind Dale.

Icewind Dale has the <singleclass>_ALL class masks in its CLASS.IDS file, but they don't work. Instead use the script trigger ClassEx() with a single class designation:

ClassEx(Myself,FIGHTER) = all fighters
ClassEx(Myself,CLERIC) = all clerics
ClassEx(Myself,DRUID) = all druids
ClassEx(Myself,THIEF) = all thieves
ClassEx(Myself,BARD) = all bards
ClassEx(Myself,MAGE) = all magi

Some multi/dual-class characters can satisfy multiple tests (Fighter/Thief = all fighters, all thieves), so you need to use the ! (not) operator to rule out classes you don't want, if any. Icewind Dale uses ClassEx() in dialogs the same way BG2 uses Class() with class masks. Keep in mind that dual-class characters who have not grown enough in their new class to regain the abilities of their old class will only be detectable by means of their new class. IWD lacks BG2's kits and special classes so there is less to test for.

This is the case regardless of whether HoW/TLM are installed; they don't add a modified CLASS.IDS into the override folder so the original (BIFed) IWD version is used.
