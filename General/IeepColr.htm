<p align="center"><font size="4">How can I edit item colors in IEEP ?</font></p>
<p><font face="arial" size="2">Q : I don't understand how I can edit the Item
Colors In IEEP Item Maker.<br>
When I enter the Parameters in Set Item Color, I see &quot;Gradient Number&quot;
and four fields next to it. I would like to know what figures I have to type in
to get different colors. Is there a scale for this?? and in effect Shining
Colors by RGP, again the parameters RGB color: &quot;RGB color&quot; and four
fields next to it. The last Parameter in Shining Colors by RGB &quot;Location
and Speed&quot; In what of the four fields I have to type the Location and Speed
coz there a 4 of them....??</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A : When editing non-shining colors, make a new effect, and
select 'Set Item Colors'. Set Duration to 'while equipped', Probability to 100%,
Saves to 'bypass resistance, &amp; no save, and target to 'self'. Now, when you
open the parameters box, you will see two boxes. The bottom box is for
'location', and the number value for the various body/weapon areas is given
above. The top box is 'color gradients', and you set this to the color you want
that part to be. Now, look at the very top left of IEEP - you see where it sez 'color
gradient scheme'? This lists a load of the colors available, and to their left
is their value (that goes in the 'Gradient' box' in hexadecimal. You have to
change this to a decimal number before you fill in the box. Any calculator will
be able to do this. Then, presto - one colored item!<br>
<br>
The process for Shining Colors is slightly different. Instead of being presented
with a simple format, the parameters screen shows two rows of four boxes. The left most
box on the BOTTOM row is the 'location' box, and functions just like the above
explanation. Leave the next box along from this at zero. Then, the next box
along is the speed of the 'flash'. This is a number from 1 - 255, with 1 being
real, real fast, and 255 being snail-like. Set this to whatever you want. Leave
the next box along blank.<br>
On the top row, there are 4 boxes. Leave the left most box at zero. The next
three boxes are the RedGreenBlue value of the color, so if you wanted pure red,
The 4 boxes would look like this : 0, 255, 0, 0. If you wanted pure Green, it
would be 0, 0, 255, 0. The RGB colors can be seen in the palette of any paint
package. Just set these values to whatever you want, and off you go.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps ('cos I can't think of a simpler way to explain it right now -
I need some sleep)<br>
