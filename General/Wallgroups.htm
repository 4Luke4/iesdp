<p><font size="6">How to edit wall groups&nbsp;</font></p>
<p> by Potencius :<br>
<br>
Areas are divided up into a grid of wall groups. Each block in the grid is 600x450 pixels on the actual area, 60x45 pixels on the
mini-map (depending on the reduction factor , sometimes these values for minimap
are different) , and 10x7.5 tiles.<br>
<br>
The grid blocks must go in a specific order. I have listed this order in the attached JPG.<br>
<br>
NOW... the reason for this. All individual walls in Wall group 0 must also be in Grid Block 0.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE:<br>
If a wall in Wall group 0 is only partially in Grid Block 0, then only the part in Grid Block 0 is active. If a wall in
Wall group 0 is not in Grid Block 0 at all, it WILL NOT work.<br>
<br>
Now, what do you do to fix this? Simple. Any walls that are overlapping Grid Blocks should be added to their respective
Wall groups. For Example... I have drawn a wall that overlaps Grid Block 0 and Grid Block 1. Therefore, I must add that wall to
Wall group 0 and Wall group 1.<br>
<br>
NOTE: there seems to be some overlapping of Grid Blocks starting in the first and second horizontal rows of Grid Blocks. You may want to investigate that further. -- forget this note now.<br>
<br>
Example : </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/AR0400WALLS.JPG" width="360" height="288"></p>
