This would be a good way to expose GUI Editing&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I’m sure you know about the so-called ”skins”. Programs like WinAmp and ICQ can be customized to look exactly like you want it to. Now, so can the Infinity Engine games…And it’s not very hard to do!<br>
<br>
The GUI (Graphics User Interface) editing is a small part of todays IE editing. However, it is a way to really enhance your game and give it a unique look. In this tutorial, I will explain how to modify your Icewind Dale start screen, but let’s hear something about the basics first. If you already know about BAM and MOS files, you can skip the following section.&nbsp;<br>
In this tutorial, I assume you’re familiar with extracting BIF files and using the override folder.<br>
<br>
Needed tools: Image editor, Bifftoool, BAMWorkshop and MOSWorkshop<br>
<br>
Okay, extract the GUIbam.bif and GUImos.bif using the bifftool<br>
<br>
NOTE: This tutorial can be used for any Infinity Engine game, but you must note that some file names might not be the same!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
http://www.geocities.com/demonlibrary/guitutorial.zip [NOTE: Right-click and select: "Save destination as" in order for the link to work]<br>
This is some pics I made for this tutorial. They are all in JPG format, and can be exported into BAM- and MOSWorkshop and saves as those BAM and MOS files. More on that later.<br>
<br>
<br>
MOS and BAM files<br>
<br>
You can split the GUI into two parts:<br>
<br>
-     The background<br>
-     The buttons<br>
<br>
<br>
The background of the GUI is a single MOS file. MOS files are flat, static images. There can be NO animations in a MOS file. They are comparable to a BMP or JPEG image.<br>
<br>
The buttons in the GUI are BAM files. BAM files are the main hub of graphics in the Infinity Engine: Spell, item and weapon icons, character animations, Spell animations, GUI buttons…All that (and more) is made of BAM files. The BAM files are split up in sequences, which contain the various frames of the animation. What we want to look at is the button BAMs. Each sequence is a button, and each frame is a bitmap picture.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here is how the sequences in the START.bam (and most other button BAMs) looks<br>
<br>
Sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5<br>
- Frame 1: This is the button´s normal state.&nbsp;<br>
- Frame 2: This is the button´s down state.<br>
- Frame 3: This is the button’s greyed-out state.<br>
<br>
The normal state is displayed as default.&nbsp;<br>
The down state is displayed when the button is clicked<br>
The greyed out state is displayed when the buttons option is unavailable.<br>
<br>
That's the scoop on BAMs, now, let's take a closer peek on the MOS files.<br>
<br>
<br>
The background of your skin&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Open up the START.mos file in MOSWorkshop. This is the startup background from Icewind Dale, I’m sure you recognize it. Now, let’s edit it! Export the MOS file as a BMP or something similiar, and open it up in a graphics editing program. PhotoShop or Paint Shop Pro are both good. You can also make a new one from scratch, just make sure it is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high. This is not a PhotoShop or Paint Shop Pro tutorial, but I’ll give you some tips and tricks anyway:<br>
<br>
- Remember the placement of the buttons. You could for example take a screenshot and use it for reference. It looks good if you made the buttons so they fit well in with the design of the MOS file. Look at how Black Isle did it: They made a small area of stone, where the buttons would fit perfectly in.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
- Remember to focus on the piece in the foreground<br>
<br>
- Don’t make your image too bright or with too strong colors. This will look messy and somewhat childish.<br>
<br>
- If you plan on editing more than one screen, apply the same design to all screens! It looks fucked up if you go from a very reddish screen with a medieval design to a bluish screen with the a futuristic design, and then to a greenish screen with an egyptic design!<br>
<br>
Feel free to use the one in the Zip file, since it’s your first time.<br>
<br>
Import your image into MOSWorkshop, and go to Save As, and save it as START.mos in your override folder. It is very important to get the name right, or the game will ignore the changes. Try starting your game. Whoa, eh? Looks kewl, doesn’t it? But the buttons seem kinda’ malplaced, so we’ll get down to changing those in just a minute. Now light a cigar and smile happily, knowing that you’ve taken the first step to a fully customized look of your game.<br>
<br>
<br>
The buttons<br>
<br>
Open up START.bam in BAMWorkshop. This is the button panel for the startup screen. There is 5 sequences, one for each button. You can make individual buttons, or just 5 of the same, but remember that the total number of sequenzes and frames must be exactly the same as before you edited it. If there’s just one flaw, it will look wrong. Remember that in Infinity Engine games, the turqoise color (R: 0, G: 151, B: 151) equals transparency, and the pink color (R: 255, G: 101, B: 151) equals shadow.<br>
<br>
Again, feel free to do use the ones in the Zip. Here’s how to get it right:<br>
Save the three JPGs in the Zip named: STARTnormal.jpg, STARTdown.jpg and STARTgrey.jpg&nbsp;<br>
<br>
(or make your own – it looks best if they're 170 x 46), and open up BAMWorkshop. Go to Edit | Sequence | Add Sequence, and you will see taht Sequence 0 has been added. So far, so good. Now go to the ”Frames” tab in the topright corner of BAMWorkshop. Go to Edit | Frame | Import Frame, and find the files you want to use as buttons. First, you import the normal state button, then the down state button and then the greyed out state button. Now you have a full sequence. Repeat this 5 times.<br>
<br>
This is how START.bam should look when you’re done:<br>
<br>
Sequence 0<br>
- Frame 0<br>
- Frame 1<br>
- Frame 2<br>
Sequence 1<br>
- Frame 3<br>
- Frame 4<br>
- Frame 5<br>
Sequence 2<br>
- Frame 6<br>
- Frame 7<br>
- Frame 8<br>
Sequence 3<br>
- Frame 9<br>
- Frame 10<br>
- Frame 11<br>
Sequence 4<br>
- Frame 12<br>
- Frame 13<br>
- Frame 14<br>
Sequence 5<br>
- Frame 15<br>
- Frame 16<br>
- Frame 17<br>
<br>
If you pasted the frames correctly, you can start up the game, sit back and light up another cigar, ’cos you’re da shit, and you just gave your IE game a totally unique look.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Play around with the programs, try different styles, mix things up. I will make some PhotoShop tutorials about skinning in the near future, expect to learn how to make awesome textures or realistic chains, dust, blood, scratches and more.<br>
