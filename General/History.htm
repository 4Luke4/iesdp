<p align="center"><font size="6">Site history</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">12.07.2002</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Finally IESDP came to some updates ;) and also it
has been moved back to the place where it was located previously ;) : TeamBG.com
. As for updates there are some small clarification added in various sections of
the site. Studies and stuff like working caused that I had not enough time to
focus on updating IESDP previously.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">20.05.2002</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Another small update , mainly by stuff from TBG
boards. Effects, some scripting stuff. Unfortunately because of my RL updates
are really less frequent than it was in the past.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Another news is that IESDP is 1 year old ;)~ . I
created it one year ago on the Worldzone server as part of my site about IE
editing . Later thanks to many contributors and friends from TBG and other
places ... and also nameless contributors ;) IESDP has been growing up ;)
gathering more and more data useful for modders ;)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">I think I will still maintain IESDP and discover
new stuff when time will allow me ;) and update by stuff discovered by
others.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">28.03.2002</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Next update , some contributions in file types (
ARE, ITM, STO for example ) also some small corrections in effects section and
in 2DAs ... more things will be updated soon.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">20.02.2002</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Today next update , in mean time I have changed
banners and background of&nbsp; the site ... also still have to find time to
work on merged version with TeamBG site. For now there are one update in ARE ,
some updates in Scripting and Effects .</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">08.02.2002</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">The IESDP has been updated again , several less
important updates in various sections - effects, 2DAs, some updates in CRE file
format.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">04.02.2002</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">The site has been again updated , new banners
made for IESDP and totally new organization of effects section introduced. The
IESDP will be also added to TeamBG as one of integral parts of it , but the
existing version that may be downloaded will be continued.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">02.02.2002</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Finally ! after so long time there has been made
next update of IESDP . It seems that new year brought some fresh changes here.
and finally some of the not uncovered things were found out like MVE format that
will be not described however or some other formats including VAR format, more
details about other formats. There will be also changes in site layout - new
banners for example.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">25.11.2001</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Several new updates. The IESDP will be for now
probably established on Brinkster server.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">31.10.2001</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Generally site was totally redesigned and really
updated by a lot of new info. Problems on IE scene forced me to upload IESDP
into another place.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Also there are added a lot of new information
like numerous tutorials about IE features editing.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">17.10.2001</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Some updates in ARE, WED , TIS formats as well as
several changes in 2DAs section, added tutorial how to manage walls attributes
using hex editor. Site redesigned again a little , new title
added and banner project.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">21.09.2001</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Because of some technical problems with my
hardware the 16.09.01 update was never uploaded and now there will be some more
new things in this release of IESDP.&nbsp;Today several various updates , I have
updated mine tutorial, added Potencius's wallgroups editing description and
added several other new data in file formats, 2DA section, scripting, and
effects.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">16.09.2001</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Minor updates of various sections. My personal
involvement in research work will be probably smaller for now (so there will be
no more frequent updates - I expect next one either in case of any significant
discovery or somewhere in October or November), because of my own work on Add-on
for BG2 ToB. That is why I ask for any help to make research for other IE games
not described with enough details.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">There is only possibility that I may publish here
parts of my own internal mod notes about various technical aspects of MODs
making</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">I will be updating IESDP by information posted on
IESR unless there are some specific requests to analyze something that I would
do myself.&nbsp;</font></p>
