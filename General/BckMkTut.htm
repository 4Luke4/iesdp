<p>Before I begin, make sure that you have the following items:<br>
<br>
1. A 3d modeling / animation program (3DSM, Maya Truespace,  etc.)<br>
<br>
2. the Infinity Campaign Maker<br>
3. A 2d graphics program such as Paint Shop Pro /Photoshop.<br>
<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><font size="4"><a name="F1">Step 1: Scene Creation<br>
</a></font><br>
When creating the 3d environment which will be your new area, keep in mind that you will want to be viewing it from a 3/4, diagonal view. Thus, when you are setting up your camera (or viewport position), ensure that it is not viewing your environment directly front-on, but on a horizontal tilt (that is to say that if you have a square room, you should be seeing the corner, not the front of the wall). As for the vertical tilt, you would do well to take a screenshot of an in-game area similar to the one you are trying to model, and compare the angle they used. (it will be roughly 3/4 top-down).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
After you have established an angle, you can begin to develop your environment, but keep this in mind:<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#996600">Use of perspective in your environment</font><br>
</b><br>
3dsmax for one, and I am sure many other programs as well, has a default render viewport setting at "perspective". If you are not familiar with this term, it means that it is attempting to show your scene as it would appear through a human eye (areas closer to the viewer are larger, and areas farther back are smaller). This can create a bit of a "fishbowl" look in some scenes, and you may want to turn it off. You should understand, however, that perspective is very useful in some smaller scenes as it gives a more "involving", realistic" look and feel to an area if things are jutting towards the eye.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for scene development, and subject matter....well, that will obviously be up to you and you personal taste, but
<b> here are several things you may not want to find in a scene:</b><br>
<br>
1. too much open space (blank floor space)<br>
<br>
 - This holds true especially in places like a city, where there<br>
   would almost certainly be debris littering the ground&nbsp;<br>
   in many places. Keep the eye busy. A barrel or a banana&nbsp;<br>
   peel may go a long way to adding to the realism of an<br>
   area.<br>
<br>
2.   Straight White lighting<br>
<br>
   - There is no place in this world, or in the world of BG that<br>
      has a pure white ambient light color. This having been<br>
      said, even in bright *pure* feeling places like most&nbsp;<br>
      temples, there will be a slight yellowish tint to the light.<br>
      It all depends on the feeling you wish to generate<br>
      however. Blue >> Calming, soothing.  Red >> evil, dark<br>
      Purple / Pink >> Sensual , etc. It's ultimately your call.<br>
<br>
3.   Lack of Curves<br>
<br>
      - While it is obvious that the majority of buildings will be<br>
        rectangular in shape, the eye tends to become bored<br>
        with room after room of perfect rectangles. add&nbsp;<br>
        some circular objects to your environments to<br>
        make them more appealing, and less repetitive.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As I say, the rest is up to you...These are just a few guides that you can choose to follow.<br>
<br>

<font size="4"><a name="F2">Step 2. Rendering / Exporting your area tile.<br>
</a></font><br>
When rendering your scene, do it at 640*480 resolution (this seems to generally work for me, and save as a bitmap) When you have completed your environment, and rendered it to your liking, exit your 3d program, and start up ICM.<br>
<br>
<br>
Importing of Tiles / Scaling<br>
<br>
I trust, for this section that you have a fairly good understanding of ICM, and the way its menus work. (if not, there are a number of tutorials in the ICM help forum that will be able to assist
you - <a href="AreaEdit.htm">Area Editing</a>) I also assume that you have a blank (or already started) campaign ready to go.<br>
<br>
Click on "IE GAME", and then select "AREAS" from the roll down menu. Select an area that is around the size of the one you intend on creating. (thus if you want to create a fairly large orc encampment, select maybe AR2900 which is Hell). You will have to know a couple of area code references here, and have a good understanding of the map size of some areas. (use Infinity explorer to help). When you have found the area you want, select "ACTIONS", and "ADD AREA TO CAMPAIGN" (NOTE**you can try selecting "COPY AS NEW", however this does not work for all people).<br>
<br>
NOTE*** Try to select an area that is a mutiple of 100, ie.<br>
<br>
AR1200, AR1300.etc. are valid. Do not ask why, it will just make life simpler.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok. So you should have a nice area from your IE games sitting in your campaign areas tree. Double click on it, and it should bring up a small map of the entire area. Right click on the place where you would like to put your new area (yes, you will be placing it smack ontop of what is already there..) This will open a new window. Select "SAVE TO BMP" in the top left corner of the new window, and then close it.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<p><br>
Keep ICM open, but boot up your 2d graphics program. Go to your BG2 (or other IE game) folder and looking for CAMPAIGN/AREAS/. inside the AREAS/ folder there should be a bitmap named : something like ARXXX32-63.BMP, where XXX is obviously the name of the
original area it was taken from.<br>
once you have it open, go and retrieve your rendered environment which you saved as a BMP earlier. Now create a rectangular selection around your environment (leave around 150-200 pixels at the bottom so it will fit into the other bitmap you saved from ICM.) Copy and paste it onto the one you got from ICM, and save ARXXX32-63.BMP or whatever with the EXACT SAME filename it had
before, in the AREAS/ folder of you campaign directory. good.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now go back into ICM, and open up your area. click on "background" and "INSERT BMP INTO BACKGROUND". this will bring up a new menu. make sure. "preview, and quantitze tiles" are selected, and you should see a single filename in the form ARXXX32-63.BMP, select it, and a small preview pic will appear. Click "Proceed", and let it work its magic.....<br>
<br>
If you did all of this properly, there should be a **SINGLE** tile in the middle of the screen (or wherever) which has changed to your new 3d environment. Click "Files", "Export Area data to IE game", and export "Area background" then boot up BG2 and cheat your way to the area you are editing.<br>
<br>
Hopefully you be able to walk all over the part of the area that you changed, and there will be a brief moment of "hurrah, i did it". But the fight aint over yet....<br>
<br>
It is important during these "game tests" that you note how you character scales as compared to the rest of the
environment, (IE, if a Chair is twice the size of a character, the  you are doing something wrong....) To scale, simply go back into your 2d program, draw a rectangular selection around your area, and reduce size to your liking&nbsp;<br>
<br>
NOTE : DO NOT CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE WHOLE IMAGE,&nbsp;<br>
         IT MUST REMAIN IN PROPER PROPORTIONS. ONLY<br>
         CHANGE THE SIZE OF WHATEVER IS WITHIN THE<br>
         IMAGE!!!!!</p>
<p><br>
         (therefore, if you scale it to 50%, there should be<br>
           a large black (or whatever your background color is)<br>
          border around your reduced image. hard to explain,<br>
          but you must keep the entire image intact in proper<br>
          size.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Ok. Now then. To add to your area, you will have to go back into your 3d program, and create more "tiles" which you will interlock to change (eventually) the entire map.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><br>
Then export >> Test >> Curse >> Change >> Smile<br>
<br>
until you have interlocked all your scenes, and they fit together properly.<br>
<br>
In lamens terms : A decent sized area may be composed of 15<br>
                      different 3d renders all interlocked together.<br>
<br>
It is a massive amount of work, but it will be more than worth it in the end to waltz your character across a new background.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

</a></font><br>
If you are rendering in 3DSMax (probably other programs, too), you don't need to make individual tiles to slap together in a 2D program.<br>
<br>
Right-Click on the word "Camera" in the viewport, and select Show Safe Frame. Zoom in or out until the whole scene is within the frame.<br>
<br>
Hit F10 to bring up the Render Options. For the resolution, set it up to the size of the ARE BMP you want to export to. The whole scene should render with no seams.<br>
<br>
If the area's proportions are off, you can always re-render at a different resolution (a
problem since rendering takes a LONG time on big areas) or rescale the whole thing in a 2D program.</p>

<p><font size="4"><a name="F4">Quake Map Building resources</a></font></p>
<p>Here are some links to a few Quake map building resources.  The great thing about building your map in a Quake format is that there are hundreds of ready made textures that you can use.  If you have any 3d modeling experience at all, then these programs are fairly straight forward, and little 2d art skill is required since the textures are provided for you.<br>
<br>
You can build a room or an entire city with these programs, just keep in mind the isometric view of IE games and you should be fine.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/tread/">http://www.planetquake.com/tread/</a>&nbsp;
-&nbsp; Very comprehensive and feature packed map building program.  This program can't do anything that any commercial 3d program couldn't do as well, but this program's interface is designed for the specific purpose of building maps.  Textures are easy to apply and the cameras are completely
customizable.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/jamdonut/">http://www.planetquake.com/jamdonut/</a>&nbsp;
-&nbsp; Very cool texture editor.  Removes the guess work involved in texture creation by allowing the textures to be viewed as they will appear in the map.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/hfx/">http://www.planetquake.com/hfx/</a>
-&nbsp; Textures, textures and more textures.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.planetquake.com/davebulow/textures.htm">http://www.planetquake.com/davebulow/textures.htm</a>
- This guy has some very cool textures that I have not seen any where else.<br>
<br>
These tools should give you the resources to build completely custom maps for use in IE games with little artistic talent required.  Just take the time to read the manuals provided
. It will save you some initial head aches.  And most importantly, Have fun.<br>
