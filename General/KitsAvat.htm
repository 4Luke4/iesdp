<p align="center"><font size="5">How to change avatar of PC for BG2 Kits ?</font></p>
<p>Q : I'm  creating a new kit and would like to change the appearance of the character to the demon knight. I cannot just use
ShadowKeeper because I want this function to work without it for sharing purposes. I know you, Vaskez, know how to do this because I have your lich kit. How did you get the character to automatically look like a lich?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Minto</b> :&nbsp;
</p>

<p> 2 ways.<br>
1= add an item via the clab. The item alters the animation perminantly and you set the item to destroy itself after 2 seconds.<br>
2= Script it. That would mean using several stat checks greater than, alignment possabliities, class possabilities, etc and if they all match ( should me enough variables to make it only happen for that kit) then you use the 'Polymorph' scripting command.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Vaskez</b> :&nbsp;
</p>

<p> I haven't tried Minto's first way....his 2nd way is a longer way of doing it....<br>
Make a spell that  u apply at level 1 in the CLAB...have a "Set default AI script" effect....<br>
Make the script....test a variable called "morphed" or whatever...if it's not 1 (or whatever) then Polymorph(ID from animate.ids). Then set the variable to 1 to make sure it only morphs once.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>King Dutka</b> :&nbsp;
</p>

<p> Create a new innate spell.<br>
Give it the spell effect "Animation Change"<br>
The Parameter (NOT resource code) needs to be set to the number for the animation you want (found in the ANIMATE.IDS file.  Don't forget to convert the number to ... scientific thingy.)&nbsp;<br>
The number for the Demon Knight (Death Knight) is 2300. Converted it is 8960. So, the parameter for the "Animation Change" effect is 8960.<br>
<br>
Now, put the spell in your CLAB file (preferably 1st level, but any level 1-7 will do).<br>
<br>
VOILA!!
