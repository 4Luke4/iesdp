Q : Let's say I want to use an existing animation the stoneskin thingy (that rock rises from the ground and shatters when the stoneskin spell is cast - I think it's also used for some petrify spell..not sure)...let's say I
don't want&nbsp; to make an Earth themed elemental spell..let's call it Earth
Strike (could also be a monk innate ability) I want the rock animation to travel in a line toward the target and end with another graphic on impact...just how hard would it be to pull this off?<br>
<br>
And what exactly are the steps to take?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A : Well, VVC files simply put positioned graphics and sound effects together, so they won't be much use for you. The "Earth Strike" graphic, as I understand, is a ball of earth/ a rock traveling in the air, then striking the target with another impact graphic, right? If so, you need a new PRO file for the projectile graphic, meaning this post will soon go into the Other File Type Editing . I am assuming you don't want it to cause wide area of effect.<br>
<br>
Take these steps:<br>
-Create a BAM of rock or earth swirling or spinning in place, the BAM which will be display upon impact, and if you wish, its shadow in another BAM.&nbsp;<br>
-Use Infinity Projectile Utility to create a projectile with these parameters:<br>
Projectile Type: Single Target<br>
Projectile Speed: (whatever you want)<br>
Sound Resource: (again, you may leave it blank or assign a WAVC name)<br>
Graphic Resource: The name of the BAM you have created<br>
Shadow Resource: If you have, the name of the shadow BAM you created.<br>
Display: Original BAM<br>
Color: (blank)<br>
Click on Create Projectile, then name the new projectile EARTHBL<br>
-Make the spell with your damage/etc. parameters in IEEP, set type to Projectile, leave the Graphic blank, and add a Play 3D Effect, with the BAM resource as the impact BAM you have created.<br>
-Reopen IPU, click on Change Item/Spell animation, open the spell file you have created, select Extension Header 1, scroll down in the projectile list on the right, select EARTHBL, and click on Change...it's done.<br>
<br>
Q : For the play 3d effect, do I choose pre-target or self?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A : Pre-Target, as it's going to be played on the target upon impact.
