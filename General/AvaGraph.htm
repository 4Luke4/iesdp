<b>Word Up<br>
</b><br>
First, I'm not an arts student and I have bad memory, so there might be some terms I screwed up. Apologies in advance, and please correct me if you spot anything
inaccurate&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Manveru's note : Please, send corrections to <a href="mailto:manveru@poczta.onet.pl">manveru@poczta.onet.pl</a>
so I may update IESDP).<br>
<br>
Second, this is not a 3D tutorial; it's a rough Poser4 guide on making an avatar animation. It's a whole lot of difference because you can be a 3D ignorant (like myself) and still use Poser4.<br>
<br>
Last, you'll need Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7 (or any other painting programs) and Jasc Animation Shop 3 (or any other GIF-handing programs), and of course, BAMWorkshop by
Glenn Flansburg (Program can be found in TeamBG developers utilities).<br>
<br>
Okay, with all that said, and referring to the example attached above, here's how I did it:</p>
<table border="1" width="4%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><a href="#top">Top</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><br>
<b><font size="4">Base</font><a name="f7"></a><font size="4"><br>
</font></b><br>
<b>To start off&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;Launch Poser4 (I think the older versions may not have some of the things I used). You will see the default guy at the main workspace. Delete him with Figure>Delete Figure. Go over to a tab on your right and open the Libraries.<br>
<br>
<b>Body&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Choose a naked lady of your choice (I picked P4 WOMAN) and click create new figure. She will be bald, but
we will deal with hair later. Now comes the part where you change her proportions to your needs.
You will have to do this if you wish to keep to the standards of Infinity Engine female characters. For boobs, select the chest area with any of the editing tools, then adjust the proportions with the dials on the top-right. For longer legs, select one leg and scale it accordingly. Note that
you will have to constantly yank it straight with the four-arrowed tool, or else
you will end up with bow-legs. Once you are done with one leg, just select Figure>Symmetry to do the other leg. If her feet has sunk into the ground, select Figure>Drop to Floor. I also changed her face by working on the head, but this is unnecessary,
because you will not be able to see any facial features by the time you finish her.<br>
<br>
<b>Hair</b></p>
<p> Pick a hairstyle from the Libraries and apply it to your character. If the alignment is out, just adjust it with the editing tools (do some experimenting and
you will get the hang of how to work with them) and scale it accordingly.</p>
<table border="1" width="4%">
  <tr>

<p><br>
<b><font size="4">Body-painting</font><a name="f5"></a><font size="4"><br>
</font></b><br>
You will not be able to do any body-painting or tattooing in Poser. Launch your paint program and open Poser's Textures folder (the texture files are in TIF format). Find the texture corresponding to the one used by your character (if
I am not mistaken, for me, it is P4 woman texture ... you can see the texture in 3D if you use the Texture Shaded Document Display option in Poser). Paint or tattoo the texture according to the paperdoll-like layout. It helps if you think of the texture layout as a display of skinned human parts *LOL*<br>
<br>
Once you have it done to your liking, open up your animation again in Poser, and change the default Smoothed Display to Textured Display.
You will see your work of art on the body (which is still naked)<br>
<br>
For those of you who do not intend to render your animations (because of low RAM), carry on using Texture Shaded Document Display Style and ignore the rest of this section.<br>
<br>
Whatever you do, check all your settings and make sure you DO NOT antialias anything. This can cause severe color damage when you do your GIF-ing. This was my initial mistake, and you owe Soulforged for enlightenment. ;)<br>
<br>
Back to body-painting >>> Select your target (such as your creature, or hair, or ground, etc), then select Render>Options. When you open up the dialog box for Surface Materials, here's some things to remember -- ambient color should always be dark, highlight and reflective colors always bright, and for body-painting, always check the box for Texture Changes Apply to Entire Figure, or else a female's nipples might stand out pale against a black body pattern. Also, always make sure your GROUND does not have any texture nor bumps nor whatever. This will make it easier for you to do GIF-ing when the ground color is constant.<br>
<br>
To make your body design/texture come out looking like actual figure-hugging garments,
you will need bump maps. These are actually very easy to do. Let's say you are using the P4 woman texture and you have drawn some "clothing" on the "pieces of human flesh". Just open up your JPG/BMP/TIF texture file in your graphic editor (like PSP7 or PhotoShop) and save it as a grayscale file. Once black and white, just enhance the contrast and brightness, and voila, you have your bump file for your bodypaint design.<br>
<br>
Load your bump file (it will be automatically converted into a BUM file from your JPG/BMP/TIF) in the render materials window and see for yourself how the edges of your body patterns stand out in ridges and curves. The higher the contrast of black and white in your bump file, the more pronounced the "bumps" will be.</p>

<p><br>
<b><font size="4">Clothing</font><a name="f6"></a><font size="4"><br>
</font></b><br>
<b>Method 1 </b>: Using parts of the clothes provided in the Libraries.</p>
<p>>>As you would have noticed, the conforming clothes have several sections. If you select a particular section and set its properties to invisible (by Object>Properties), you get several scraps of clothing which can be tapered and resized via the dials on the right.<br>
<br>
These pieces and scraps of T-shirts, vests, blouses and jeans are really cool, because
they can be rendered with different textures, and if formed correctly, they can look like real armor by the time you shrink your creature into the size of a IE game animation. I found the catsuit useful for quick creation of arm-guards/bracers and the sleeves of mage robes (make the sleeves by selecting the upper arm and using the Taper dial). You can even use the long strip scraps of skirts to make a costume quite like Melissan's. Of course, all this takes time to mix and match, but the plus point is that these clothing can conform to your creature at all times, thus making it quickly ready for animation.<br>
<br>
<b>Method 2</b> : Using the shapes in the Props section of the Libraries.</p>
<p>>>You have a choice of sphere, cylinder, cone and ring. I seldom use the others. You can make discs and beads out of the sphere, triangles out of the cone, bangles out of the ring, etc. It's up to your imagination and how you work the dials to morph the objects. Once you have your object shaped to your desire, position them on your creature. Once in position, select Object>Change Parent and then select the part of your creature that
you are attaching the object to. Now the object moves with your creature when you animate it.<br>
<br>
Here is a wonderful way to make armor: stick objects to the body and parent the objects to the body elements! The fishscale effect when you use many disc objects are pretty cool after you're done.<br>
<br>
Another thing about these shapes/objects is that you can sink them into your creature's skin ... such as for shoulder/elbow guards, I just shoved the sphere into the joints and parent it. You
will not be able to tell the difference of clothing/prop and abnormality when you size down your avatar.<br>
<br>
<b>Method 3 </b>: Using objects from other 3D progs.</p>
<p>>>Poser can import any object from 3DStudioMax and is highly compatible with RayDream Studio. So far, all I do with the imported objects is parent them to figure elements. Anyone else out there found other uses?<br>
<br>
<b>Method 4</b>: Using transparency maps</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;I have yet to master the art of transparency, but I have a vague idea, and thought I might as well share it for others to explore it. For some clothes, such as the skirt, lets say you want to make a big slit at the side. Look for the skirt texture file and for the part where you want it to be transparent, black it out (white is opaque), convert it into grayscale format, then load it in from the Render options menu as a transparency map.</p>

<b>Light Placement</b></p>
<p align="left"><br>
<br>
To emulate the lighting effects used by IE game avatars, you'll basically need 5 spotlights (refer to the attached image above), one each at the four corners and one directly above. Keep the spotlights way up above the head level of your creature, and all your spotlights should focus on the chest, head and shoulder areas.<br>
<br>
To boost the environmental lighting, I used four infinite lights, each placed
north south east west from the creature, filling in the gaps between the four corner spotlights.<br>
<br>
Note that when you first put in lights, they are spotlights. You have to open the light properties (by selecting the light from Light Controls; or from the pulldown menu under the workspace window, then selecting Object>Properties) dialog box in order to change the spotlight into an infinite light. Infinite lights will be invisible in the workspace.<br>
<br>
While you're adjusting properties, here are some tips:<br>
<br>
-set ONLY the spotlight (or spotlights) directly above your creature to cast shadows. This will elevate the problem of long shadows stretching in all directions.<br>
<br>
-set all the infinite lights on very low, while cranking up the spotlight above your creature. The other spotlights should only be on medium low so you
do not end up with a blindingly bright and shiny thing like the stupid example up there (the actual one that's gonna appear in the game is a bit dimmer to avoid it from looking as though it glows in the dark *lol*)<br>
<br>
-for those of you who are rendering, it's VERY important that your lights should consist of colors which jive with your creature. For example, if you're doing a green nymph, make sure that the lights around her have pastel green or cyan hues and not bright reds or pinks. This is because when you render, the color from the lights will be imprinted onto your creature. (Of course, if you're doing portraits, it is a fine and artistic touch if your have various colors patched all over your subject.)<br>
<br>
-use the dials on the right side of the screen to adjust your spotlight positions with precision.</p>

<b><font size="4">Animation</font><a name="f9"></a><font size="4"><br>
</font></b><br>
Little bit on camera handling before starting your animation: Notice in the finished example, her body slides from side to side? To prevent the *ground* from sliding instead of the body, simply select your camera (the one you're recording the animation with) and Object>Point At ... and select GROUND.<br>
<br>
Now comes the hard part> animation. Hoo boy, are you in for some hard times. First,
you will have to be very careful with your mouse movements or else your character becomes a freakish lump of jutting joints. I also use a lot of the trackball and zooming tools found on the far left of the screen so I can see one pose from all angles.
They are not complicated to manipulate, really. Just be careful with that mouse.<br>
<br>
To start animating, go to the tab at the bottom of the screen and open up the frames listing. Make sure you're on the first frame, then start moving your character to the desired pose (for more accuracy, use the dials on the top-right). Once you have it perfect, save it before you can ruin it (undoing is not much of an option in Poser, so save often in order to revert in case of disaster). Now use the frame controls at the bottom of the page and move to the next frame. Make your next desired pose. For example, in the first frame, her head is turned to the left. In the second frame, just turn her head to the right (if you wish to turn her head from side to side). Etcetera for the rest of the frames. As for lighting, use the light controls on the left to adjust (this takes some time to get it at the right intensity).<br>
<br>
By now, you will have a rough animation sequence. Click to turn off Skip Frames at the far bottom right of your screen and click the play button if you wish to view the animation. At this point, it's very choppy.<br>
<br>
To smoothen the animation, select Animation>Retime Animation, where you set the source frames ranging from the first of your pose to the final pose. The destination frames should be twice or triple the amount of your source frames (if you don't have this option, just add in extra frames by selecting Animation>Properties). Once your animation is retimed,
it will be smooth because the program will do the tweening for you. If your animation is looped, select Animation>Loop interpolition and resample the key frames.<br>
<br>
To make a basic walk-animation is quite fast too. Just select Window>walk designer and you have a walk animation ... however, if your creature's proportions are not the default, you might have to tweak the key frames and then resample the whole animation so that your sexy, leggy elf will not walk like a drunken spider

<b><font size="4">Converting from exported Poser BMP files into GIF<a name="f14"></a><br>
</font></b><br>
To convert your animation into GIF, first, you move your camera to the correct angle and make sure the character size you see on your screen is the proper tiny size like in the IE BAMs. Set the background and floor color to a color that's not used by your character.<br>
<br>
For better light effects (such as in Soulforged's famous gorgeous Cleric), you can use rendering for each frame (select Render from the menu and play around with the options ...
it is all stated there quite clearly), though I have to warn you that rendering may crash any computer with less than 128MB RAM ... it sure fried my 64MB one.<br>
<br>
Now export the images (in BMP format) frame by frame (from that particular camera angle) into an external folder, then launch your GIF handling program and import all the frames to make a new animation. Oh, and
do not forget to crop your images after that. Minimal size is necessary for best results.<br>
<br>
For more GIF-ing details, I will quote Soulforged (he is using Corel Photopaint for GIF handling):<br>

        all green dominant colors (as in RGB). Then I use that as a template
        palette to convert animations in all eight directions. Because a BAM
        holds animations in all eight directions but can only have one palette.
        That is why animations for all eight direction must use the same
        palette. I delete all green dominant color because Lightwave's anti-aliasing
        cause edges to blend, hence background green is blended onto the
        character edges.</td>

        About the lighting, I have a distant light coming from above to create
        the shadow in the right angle as with other IE animations. But I noticed
        animations in IE uses inconsistent shadows angle. If you put to creature
        side-by-side, sometimes you will observe shadows casted in different
        directions. Those lazy bums at Blackisles... I also have another distant
        light directed at the front of my character so details are visible. And
        I pumped up the global lighting a bit. Also note that animations you
        make must be slightly darker, like in a dungeon. It is because IE engine
        brighten your animation in the game when you are in direct sunlight. So
        it is better to leave all the lighting effects like magic to the IE
        engine.</td>

If you want the technical details of how to plant your animation into your game (sound-matching and

</p>
<p>
 To render an animation sequence from eg. frame 1 - 14, all you have to do is go to the "make movie" option, and set the sequence type to Image files, that way you get your 14 BMP images in no time, then import into a GIF and so on... This means I can make stuff MUCH faster now, only have to wait for Avatar Workshop.....<br>
To customize the clothing, you just need to make it a morph target and use the deforming tool to reshape it. You can also add custom textures to it and a Bump map to make it look creased and wrinkly. The Bump map is just an 8bit Greyscale image of the clothing, similar to the texture map. The darker the grey, then the deeper the crease would appear on the model.<br>
<br>
If you wanted to know how to make clothes "stick" to the character, then for example, you would get a sock from the library by clicking the double tick and adding it to the view. Then you should select the model you want it to "stick" to, and go to "Object:Change Parent" menu. Go down until you see the Figure that you selected, and click on it. This will make it the parent of the sock, which will move with the model instead of being seperate.&nbsp;<br>

To see them all demonstrated in game, enable cheat codes, go into the game, and use Ctrl + S in tandem with Ctrl + A.  Ctrl + S selects the next sequence, Ctrl + A displays it.<br>
<br>
To get the simple listing, its:<br>
<br>
Pause<br>
Ready<br>
Attack -Slash<br>
Attack -Backslash<br>
Attack -Jab<br>
Attack -Shoot<br>
Damage<br>
Die<br>
Sleep<br>
Awake<br>
Conjure<br>
Cast<br>
<br>
This does not include a few, such as walk, head turning, twitching, etc.  If you want a complete list, albeit with some extra stuff, check your 2DA folder in NI, and look at any of the monster files in it, such as MGNL.2DA (Gnoll)  These files list any sound to be played with any animation, so will indirectly list them all.<br>

<font size="4"><b><a name="f12"></a>Avatar making remarks for IWD by TME :</b><br>
</font>
<br>
Note : this is ONLY for IWD.<br>
<br>
Each avatar has a number of animated .BAM files (one for attacking dying, walking, etc.) Each of these BAMs is broken up into 8 sequences (N,NW,NE,W,E,S,SW,SE)  for the different possible directions the avatar can be facing....Then, for each of these sequences, there are any number of frames (it depends of course on the length of the animation).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So, basically here's the deal. To create a *completely* new avatar you will have to replace each of the frames for each of the sequences for each of the bams for that avatar...<br>
<br>
example.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
15 frames * 8 sequences * 15 animations = 1800 frames 2 be  changed for a whole new avatar from start to finish.<br>
<br>
Don't despair though, you can use the Avatar studio (or creature bam-it or whatever it is called these days )<br>
and import animated gif files you have created to save time.<br>
<br>
Also, you can use BAMworkshop's global frame or palette changes and effects to alter entire bam files at a time (ie, change color, contrast, etc.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This would mean that you could change one .BAM file at a time. (however you are limited to a
small number of effects only)<br>
<br>
I changed the skeleton warrior avatar to "Deceptive Shade" by altering the contrast of every BAM file for that avatar to 0. It still took me about half an hour , because I had to extract all 16 or so of his animation files from Infinity Explorer and then change and save each, but it turned him all-black like a shadow.</p>
