  {% capture note %}
  - Scripts can handle `RES` filenames with `+`, Dialogs and the console cannot. Same with the `~`, `` ` ``, `'`, `@`, `$`, `^`, and `&` characters, maybe some more.
    - This action will default to a spell matching the first 7 characters in Dialogs/Console *IF* the 8<sup>th</sup> character isn't valid.
  - If `CastingLevel = 0`, then the action will use Caster Level.
