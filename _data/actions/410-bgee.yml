  It is the same as [RandomWalk()](#85), where the time parameter represents how many times the action will be ticked before terminating (Actions are normally ticked once per second at 30FPS).

  {% capture note %}
  While this action is [Wait()](#63)'ing, it won't be ticked.
  Thus, a "RandomWalkTime(1)" can technically go into a 10 second [Wait()](#63) immediately, and be blocking the action list for much longer than a second.
  If the parameter was 5, for instance, this "5" wouldn't be counting down while the script is waiting.
