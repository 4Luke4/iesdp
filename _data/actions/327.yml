  This action gives a level dependent amount of XP to the party or a single party member. The XP amount is listed in xplist.2da at the intersection of the party level (column) and quest row (the mis-named parameter). The [file](../../files/2da/2da_tob/xplist.htm) lists the same XP value for all quests for all levels.
