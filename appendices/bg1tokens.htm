  <tr>
    <td>&lt;CHARNAME&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the name of the PC.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;DAY&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the current numerical day.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;DAYANDMONTH&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the current numerical day as well as the month. (Example: It is &lt;DAYANDMONTH&gt;, would produce: It is 24 Mirtul...or whatever the current day and month happens to be.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;DURATION&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the elapsed time from the start of the game in days and hours. (Example: We've been around for &lt;DURATION&gt;, would produce: We've been around for 23 days and 13 hours...or whatever the elapsed time happens to be.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;DURATIONNOAND&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the same thing as &lt;DURATION&gt; except it omits the and. So it would be 23 days 13 hours rather than 23 days and 13 hours.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;GABBER&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the name of the current speaker. (Example: If I use Jaheira and click-talk her on a creature rather than using the PC, this would return Jaheira if used in a dialogue.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;GAMEDAY&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the current game day. (Starts at 1 for a new game.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;GAMEDAYS&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the number of game days that have elapsed since the start of the game. (Starts at 0 for a new game.)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>&lt;HOUR&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the current hour of the day in numerical 24 hour format.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;MINUTE&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the current number of real-time minutes (0-59) that have passed in the last hour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;MONTHNAME&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the current month's name. (Example: It is &lt;MONTHNAME&gt;, would produce: It is Mirtul...or whatever the current month is in your game.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;YEAR&gt;</td>
    <td>Returns the current year in numerical format. (Example: It is &lt;YEAR&gt; currently, would produce: It is 1369 currently...or whatever year it is in your game.</td>
