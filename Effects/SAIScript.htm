<p align="center"><font size="5">Set AI Script usage</font></p>
<p>Answers by Vaskez, Kensai Ryu, and Mary Magus<br>
<br>
Q : Can someone give me some insight on the Change AI Script effect?  For instance, if I use the Override value in Parm1, does it permanently replace the script or override it for the duration specified or what?  (I hope it's only temporary!) Also, which script precisely is overriden?  It looks like I can change specific scripts like class or race, etc. but the override seems generic.  Does that mean it overrides whatever script might be *in play* at the time?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A : Change AI script sets the script that you specify to take effect on the target creature at the level you specify. Override level means it overrides all other scripts. It doesn't mean that the other scripts are altered. They aren't the scripts at all other levels are still there it's just that if the override script tells the cre to do something at the same time as another script tells it to do some action, the action in the override script will be performed.<br>
<br>
A : ChangeAIScript changes the script in the target permanantly.<br>
Be careful about changing any creature's override script, I have noticed that many NPC's and PC's use override scripts to interact with the party, each other and the events around them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A : If you want this spell to be used by enemies in the game or for your character only. If it's for player character only, then it's easy. I think that unless you have specifically set another script on your character, the only one script that is set is the one u set on the record screen and IIRC that takes up the Class script level. So just set the OVERRIDE script, (param is 0) to your script with target caster or self. Then have the script cast the spell on certain enemies. And then put in another delayed spell effect that sets the override script back to nothing or "". Another way you could do it is to set a global in the script once the spell is cast by the script and then test the global and set the script to none again. Like this:<br>
<br>
IF<br>
SpellCast(Myself,SPELLINIDS)<br>
Global("spellcast", "LOCALS",0)<br>
THEN&nbsp;<br>
RESPONSE #100<br>
SetGlobal("spellcast","LOCALS",1)<br>
ApplySpell(targ et,spell) //or Spell() or ForceSpell or SpellRES etc.<br>
END<br>
<br>
IF<br>
Global("spellcast","LOCALS",1)<br>
T HEN&nbsp;<br>
RESPONSE #100<br>
ChangeAIScript("",OVERRIDE)<br>
END<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
or if u ONLY use this script for this spell, u could just do:<br>
<br>
IF<br>
True()<br>
THEN&nbsp;<br>
RESPONSE #100<br>
ApplySpell(target,spell) //or Spell() or ForceSpell or SpellRES etc.<br>
//apply the spell to whoever u want<br>
Continue()<br>
END<br>
<br>
IF<br>
True()<br>
THEN&nbsp;<br>
RESPONSE #100<br>
ChangeAIScript("",OVERRIDE)<br>
END<br>
<br>
<br>
of course....this is just the outline for your script. You'd need to test which creatures are within range of the spell etc.<br>
<br>
A : Unfortunately, there is no way to check which AI script is set on the creature. And yes, setting a script means that any previoously set script is now ..not set hehe...or "blown-away" as you put it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The General, Default etc. are levels of script. So you can have more than one script running on a creature at once. One at the deafult level, one at the general level etc. THat is why I said what I did about the OVerride script taking precedence over the others...but not not deleting them from the creature because it is at a different level. To sum it up, any creature may have up to 5 different scripts running on it...in the default, general, race, class and override 'slots'. I think Specifics is for something else....<br>
<br>
<br>
Now since it is for player characters only then u can still share it with others....just include the script with your spell. The only problem is when people use other custom spells which might also set an override script. AFAIK nothing in the game sets override scripts on PCs...so your only problem is other customs.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A : Instead of worrying about overwriting a creature's override script.....summon a new creature that is invisible and immortal and set that creature's override script to the script u want. THen destroy the creature after the script has run. DestroySelf()<br>
The only problem is the summoning flash.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A : All the different script locations are in specific order based on weight.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Heres the order:<br>
<br>
0 OVERRIDE<br>
1 AREA<br>
2 SPECIFICS<br>
4 CLASS<br>
5 RACE<br>
6 GENERAL<br>
7 DEFAULT<br>
<br>
That means that the parser starts at the O location and works it way downward until it runs through all seven locations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As you can see, specifics is indeed a script location, however this location can also hold a value, or if you add text to your SPECIFIC.ids, it can also hold text.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
However I would not modify the SPECIFIC location, on PC's like Edwin or Korgan, etc.  As some of them run scripts from this location.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some creatures in game (such as Adalon) also use this location for specific NPC data, telling them to attack certain things, change this and you mess up those events.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A : As to script levels, % are reflected in the cre files and savegame cre's.<br>
<br>
0 OVERRIDE     Character, always active<br>
1 AREA           Stored in the current AREA.<br>
2 SPECIFICS    Specifics is stored in the cre, to quote the original IESDP:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
0x0274      1 (byte)      "Specific" type (see SPECIFIC.IDS).<br>
<br>
I have never tried changing scripts at this level, however ( I always use ChangeSpecifics for not repeating actions on cres ), but as you say the game does, and I know others have as well.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The games do no use Scroll level three...there is not  such a location, as the IDS files simply cross reference text to engine internals. So if there was such a location that could be used, it would be in the IDS files. However, you can compile a script using that location (3) in the script, however I am almost positive it will not change anything (good to test this though, see what happens...I could be wrong =) ).&nbsp;<br>
4 CLASS         Character, active when party scripts are active<br>
5 RACE           Character, active when party scripts are active<br>
6 GENERAL      Character, active when party scripts are active<br>
7 DEFAULT      Character, active when party scripts are active<br>
<br>
