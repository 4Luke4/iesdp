<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>SPL casting times and delays</b></font></p>
<p>Q : Do spell effects take effect sequentially one after the other or do they in essence happen simultaneously?<br>
<br>
Is there a way to make an actual effect like the stun effect in my spell both delay before being applied and have a duration (I want it to last 15 seconds)?<br>
<br>
How does *Casting Time* play into all of this?  Do the effects wait until the casting is over before they kick in?  It appears that casting time only applies to the casting animation but I'm not sure.<br>
<br>
Vaskez A : About time delays....I only have BG2 but in that time is exactly 12 times faster than in real life. Probably it's the same in BG1. So if u want something delayed for 2 hours real time, then yeah...7200 seconds...although I think this carries on while u sleep which is as if 8 hours game time = 480/12 = 40 minutes of real time had gone. 1 Turn is 1 minute. This is all for BG2 though, I'm assuming it's the same.<br>
<br>
Yes...casting time delays the start of the effects. So a casting time of 10 means the effects are applied 1 round after u click on the cast button. All spell effects that have instant effect take place simultaneously and all that are delayed by the same amount also take place simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Now of course Delayed/Permanent effects are easy. Delayed/Duration effects which you are looking for are currently controlled by an unknown timing mode in BG2 which is 3. I have used this successfully with certain spell effects but it uses some unknown values in the spell file and I'm still looking into it so you are treading on what I reckon is fresh ground....maybe u should do a workaround with a script.</p>
