<p><b><a name="f1">What is this ?</a></b></p>
<p>The CLUA Console is basically a way of bringing files into the game which are in a .bif or in the override folder.  It is also used to change settings in the game and to move to a different area.<br>
<br>
Generally CLUAConsole was created as debugging tool used to modify parameters during running the game to shorten times of testing.<br>

How to access CLUAConsole ?</a></b></p>
<p>Each game has a slightly different way of accessing the console, so I'll go through them in chronological order:<br>
<br>
BALDUR'S GATE I and TALES OF THE SWORD COAST<br>
<br>
- Go to your Baldur's gate (BG) directory and open the file Baldur.ini (it's a notepad with a gold cog on it).<br>
- Scroll down to the heading "Game Options" and add the line underneath: "Cheats=1" (case sensitive). Save.<br>
- Load a saved game, and press CTRL and TAB at the same time.  A little text box will pop up.<br>
- You may now enter any of the CLUA Commands.  All commands start with "CLUAConsole:" then the command after the colon.  Refer to the end of this post for the commands.<br>
<br>
<br>
ICEWIND DALE<br>
<br>
- Open your Icewind Dale (IWD) Directory and look for Icewind.ini (a notepad with a gold cog).<br>
- Scroll down to the heading "Game Options" and enter the following line underneath: Cheats=1 (case sensitive). Save.<br>
- Load any saved game and press CTRL and TABat the same time.  A text box will pop up.<br>
- In the text box, type "CHEATERSDOPROSPER:" you may now use any of the commands after the colon. Refer to the end of this post for the commands.<br>
<br>
<br>
IWD: HEART OF WINTER<br>
<br>
- Repeat every step for Icewind Dale (above) except, on the last step, it is "GETYOURCHEATON:" instead.  All commands may follow the colon, refer to the end of this tutorial.<br>
<br>
<br>
BALDUR'S GATE 2: SHADOWS OF AMN and THRONE OF BHAAL<br>
<br>
- Go to your Baldur's gate 2 directory, and open the file Baldur.ini (a notepad file with a gold cog).<br>
<br>
You now have two options:<br>
<br>
- Scroll down to the "Game Options" heading and add the line: "Cheats=1" (case sensitive) underneath.<br>
- Now go in game, opening any saved game.  Press CTRL and SPACE BAR at the same time.  A text box will pop up at the bottom.  Type "CLUAConsole:EnableCheatKeys(1);" into the box and press ENTER. Now Type the line "CLUAConsole:".  Any of the commands below may be used after the colon.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
- Under the "Program Options" heading add the line: "Debug Mode=1" (case sensitive) underneath. Save. Now open BG2 and load any saved game.  Press CTRL and SPACE BAR at the same time. A text box will appear.  Now Type the line "CLUAConsole:".  Any of the commands below may be used after the colon.<br>
<br>
To remove the Console window, just press ESC (sometimes this won’t work, but you can go to i.e. records page then return to game screen and Console window won’t be there any more).<br>
</p>

COMMANDS<br>
</a></b></p>
<p>
Just type these commands after the first portion of the Command, given in the instructions for each game.  There should be no spaces and the commands are case sensitive, although the file names are not.  Press enter to finish the command.<br>
<br>
CreateItem(&quot;X&quot;, Y, Z1, Z2)<br>
<br>
The numbers Z1 and Z2 aren't generally used except for items with multiple
abilities like wands.<br>
<br>
In BG2 you could create a wand of fire with 5 charges of fireball and 5 charges
of Aganazzer's Scorcher, like this:<br>
<br>
CLUAConsole:CreateItem(&quot;wand05&quot;,5,5)<br>
<br>
CreateCreature(&quot;xxxxxxxx&quot;)<br>
<br>
NOT AVAILABLE FOR ICEWIND DALE, HEART OF WINTER OR TRIALS OF THE LUREMASTER<br>
Creates a Creature, centre screen, into the game.  xxxxxxxx is the creature filename, which may only be up to 8 letters long.<br>
<br>
MoveToArea("AR####")<br>
<br>
Moves the entire party to the specified area file.  Although I give the example "AR####" that is for only the in-game areas.  Custom made areas put together by people here at TeamBG or elsewhere may not use the "AR" part.  #### is always four numbers.<br>
<br>
SetCurrentXP(##)<br>
<br>
Sets the party's experience to the number specified.  Simple as that.<br>
<br>
SetGlobal("name","YYYYYY",#)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This changes the chosen Global. YYYYYY is GLOBAL, LOCAL or an area filename (AR####).  "name" is name of the Global and # is the number to set the Global too.<br>
<br>
eg. for BG2:<br>
<br>
CLUAConsole:SetGlobal(&quot;IESDP&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL",1)<br>
<br>
AddGold(####)<br>
<br>
Adds #### gold to the party's total. #### are of course numbers.<br>
<br>
ExploreArea()<br>
<br>
Removes all unexplored (black) areas from the map.<br>
<br>
SetWeather(#)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Use one of the following 3 settings for #:&nbsp;<br>
0 - No Weather  1 - Rain   2 - Snow<br>
<br>
AddSpell("xxxxxxxx")&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Where xxxxxxxx is a spell file code&nbsp;<br>
Note: the cursor must be over the person who you want to get the spell and the spell will be memorized in all empty slots and added to the spell book<br>
<br>

CLUAConsole Commands for BG2 (Written by Extremist with edition of Manveru and
Weasel)<br>
</font></b>
<br>
<b><a name="f4">
BG1 leftovers - they are valid for BG1/IWD/BG2<br>
</a></b>
<br>
Yes, the Console was part of BG1 too and the commands from BG1 are copied in BG2. Console in BG2 recognizes them all, but some won’t work because there are no files from BG1 needed for those commands. This list contains them all with comments.<br>
To engage them you need to type CLUACheats:COMMAND, i.e. for command CowKill you’ll type CLUACheats:CowKill.<br>
<br>
CowKill()<br>
places a certain scroll in your inventory&nbsp;<br>
<br>
CriticalItems()<br>
places Invitation, Empty Letter and Sarevok's Diary in your inventory<br>
<br>
DrizztAttacks()<br>
DrizztDefends()<br>
these two commands lacks additional file to work, first one should spawn hostile Drizzt in BG1, and second was supposed to spawn friendly Drizzt<br>
<br>
FirstAid()<br>
places 5 potions of healing, 5 antidotes and 1 Stone to Flesh scroll in your inventory<br>
<br>
Hans()<br>
Midas()<br>
Discover their usage by yourself<br>
<br>
TheGreatGonzo()<br>
Spawns 10 rabid chickens to fight at your side</p>
<p>In case of IWD and HoW we use the proper syntax - like&nbsp;
CHEATERSDOPROSPER:ExploreArea() for area exploring.</p>

BG2 SoA/ToB CLUAConsole commands<br>
</a></b>
<br>
This list shows all CLUAConsole commands available to use in SoA. For some of them I never discovered how to put them working.<br>
To engage them you need to type CLUAConsole:COMMAND, i.e. for command ExploreArea you’ll type CLUAConsole:ExploreArea().<br>
<br>
Numeric arguments will have certain restrictions, i.e. you can’t set experience above the XP cap.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
AddGold(X)<br>
Gives your party amount of X gold.<br>
<br>
AddSpell("X")<br>
Used to add any spellcaster a certain spell. Where X is SPL filename without
extension.</p>
<p><br>
AdvanceRealTime(X)<br>
This command I dedicate to Slappy and BTA (Jaheira's *khm*  ). The X value determines REAL time advancing (not advancing ingame time like CTRL+T). Values IMHO determine real time to add like this:<br>
7200 1 day<br>
14400 2 days<br>
21600 3 days<br>
28800 4 days<br>
36000 5 days<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
CreateCreature("X")<br>
Creates in neighborhood creature from specified CRE files=X<br>
<br>
CreateEngine(X)<br>
I don't have the slightest idea what's this command used for. Try it with X values 0 and 1. I haven't found other values that will work anything. But interesting effect, ain't it?<br>
<br>
CreateItem("X", Y, Z1, Z2)<br>
Again common known command that creates Y items code of is X. Values Z1 and Z2 don't mean anything IMHO.<br>
Values Y, Z1 and Z2 are not needed to be filled, so a command can look like CreateItem("X") and in that case it creates only one item which has code X. Particular item codes find by yourself.<br>
<br>
CreateVEFVidCell("X")<br>
Used to test single graphic effects. Displays VVC files,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;for example :<br>
CLUAConsole:CreateVEFVidCell("SPSARMOR")<br>
CLUAConsole:CreateVEFVidCell("SPTURNI2")<br>
<br>
DisplayAllBAMFiles()<br>
As it says, this command test ALL graphic animations within the game. If you engage it, prepare to see many BLANKS (pauses).<br>
<br>
DisplayText("X")<br>
Text within quotes is displayed in dialog window. This command can be used to spice up Shot of the week.<br>
<br>
EnableCheatKeys(X)<br>
Simple, keyboard press combos that can be used to cheat are enabled if X value is 1. Value 0 disables it.<br>
<br>
ExploreArea()<br>
Reveals whole map of area you're currently in.<br>
<br>
GetGlobal("X", "Y")<br>
Displays value of game variable X. Type of variable is determined by Y.<br>
<br>
MoveToArea("X")<br>
Transports party to area X. Codes that can be used for X find by yourself.<br>
<br>
PlaySound("X", Y, Z)<br>
Plays a sound from within a game. Value Y detemines volume (100 – max). Value Z is not used.
Plays WAVC or WAV file with specified name in X without extension.<br>
<br>
SetCurrentXP(X)<br>
Sets experience for selected NPC or party. X won't pass XP cap.<br>
<br>
SetGlobal("X", "Y", Z)<br>
Sets Z value to game variable X. Type of variable is determined by Y (GLOBAL, LOCALS or ARxxxx).<br>
<br>
SetWaterAlpha(X)<br>
Dunno what does this do.<br>
<br>
SetWeather(X)<br>
Command sets weather for next hour. Values mean:<br>
0 – no weather<br>
1 – rain<br>
2 – snow<br>
Press CTRL+T once after the command is issued to engage the weather change.<br>
<br>
StartStore("X")<br>
I never made this command work. Try to discover it yourself or ask on BG2 official site.<br>
<br>
StrrefOff()<br>
StrrefOn()<br>
Not a clue why are these commands here.<br>
<br>
TestAllDialog()<br>
If you engage this command, prepare for looooooong wait for it to end. But, you'll discover that Black Isle probably never used it – it WILL display dialog errors!?<br>
<br>
Some more commands exist, but some don't work (I presume) like CInfGame:GetWordTimer() and some make the game crash like CBaldurChitin:SetLimitTransparency(X). But, obviously, the story about console is not finished yet.<br>
