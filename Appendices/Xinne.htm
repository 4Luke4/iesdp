<i>Ok just to start off....this is pretty easy stuff. All you have to do is use
someone elses CLAB file, give it what you want, RENAME it CLABMA08 (for
illusionist) and paste it into the override folder. Look into the kitlist to see
what CLAB each class uses...... Ta Da!!!!<br>
<br>
I couldnt find the regular mage, but i believe the sorcerer is the WILDMAGE (Tee
hee hee) Have fun editing.<br>
<br>
I believe the kitlist is the most important tool for kit editing, now im going
to try to give my sorcerer new weapon skills.<br>

<i>Ok i made a small mistake. To furthur edit a mage kit, you will be
overwriting an older specialist mage kit.<br>
<br>
Lets take the abjurer from the kitlist2da<br>
22 ABJURER 597 502 9564 CLABMA02 21 0x00000040 1<br>
<br>
The first number (22) DONT CHANGE IT!<br>
Also dont change the name of the kit ABJURER<br>
The number (597) is the TLK file saying the name of the kit in the mage kit area
(you probably want to change this using the DialogTLK editor to give your kit a
new name)<br>
The number (502) is the TLK file saying the name of the kit appearing on the
character sheet<br>
(same as above to change it)<br>
The number (9564) is the description of the kit (same as above to change it)<br>
The CLABMA02 file is where you will give it its new abilities<br>
The number (21) is for proficiency's (i think you can change that too)<br>
The other number is for unusables<br>
The last number determines which class your kit is in. (DO NOT CHANGE)<br>

I think all of this should work!<br>

<span class="title"><font size="5">make bard song do almost ANYTHING you want it to!!</font></span>
<p>
this is a must know for using the bard class as a fighter-mage multi-class kit
option, and for new bard kits that have different bard songs.<br>
<br>
while trying to find a way to disable bard song, i was checking out the skalid
bard kit as a reference, to see how they made his song into something toally
different than normal song<br>
<br>
well, turns out that there is an eff file (#251) that re-referances bard song to
another file.<br>
<br>
you can totally change everything that bard song does with this eff, i don't
want to explain the entire process (cause i'm lazy) but you can check out the
way the eff file works in the spells Spcl542 and Spcl542a. these are direct AP_
spells from the skalid kit. in the referance for eff #251 it has the Spcl542a
spells name, when you open up the Spcl542a spell you can totally change
everything it does with bard song!!! (in my case it was to totally disable it by
removeing all the headers and effects)<br>
<br>
just remeber, for this to work it has to be AP_ at level 1 in the class ablility
file, and instead of adding diferent variations (my spelling sux) of the spell
for diferent levels you just add new headers and set the level for what you want
all the new abilitys to be (note: this is not cumulative, you have to add
everything back in and raise it up or not if thats how you want it.)<br>
<br>
anyway, just thought i would share this great info with everyone else around
here. now i'm going to go finish my Blade Singer kit (which is almost as close
to the true kit in the elven hand book as the engien will allow for now

<span class="title">Re: For anyone (scripters)</span>
<p>
Well, the best way is to use a dialog that freezes all options... it's not
available in the current IDU, but you can hex it in by adding 00 00 00 00 to the
header at 0x030. Then you need to increment all the offsets by 4.<br>
<br>
Or, you could just try using a ClearAllActions() thing when the creature starts
dialog

like in 7F summon creature friendy : the resref_1 could refer to a 2da file
which allow u to summon a random type of creature, i've done a elf invocation
effect which allow u to invoke some warrior or mage elf<br>
<br>
i 've a pb, the effect seem to don't work with some characters like drizzt.
could it be possible ?<br>

<p>This was ask in another forum but refer to this one...<br>
<br>
to have weapon double damage (this means add the same damage as the weapon
itself)<br>
<br>
use the effect EFF in IEEP with no param or 0,2<br>
these effect nothing<br>
<br>
and create an .EFF with those param<br>
<br>
179 =Damage vs a Specific creature (0x10) here (B3=179 in hexadecimal format)<br>
param_2= target creature (0x1c) exple 79000000<br>
param_3=ref to an ids file (0x20) exple 04000000<br>
Nb Dice Rolled=Nb Dice Rolled (0x3 exple 04<br>
Dice Type#Dice Type (0x3c) exple 08<br>
param_5 Dmg Bonus (0x60) exple 05<br>
<br>
Nb don't forget to put 64 (=100%) in (0x2c)<br>
<br>
this means i have 100 % to succed in doing 4d8 +5 damage against all demonic<br>
<br>
the ref to the ids file is treated like this<br>
&quot;03000000&quot; =&gt; &quot;General.ids&quot;,<br>
&quot;04000000&quot; =&gt; &quot;Race.ids&quot;,<br>
&quot;05000000&quot; =&gt; &quot;Class.ids&quot;,<br>
&quot;08000000&quot; =&gt; &quot;Align.ids&quot;<br>
<br>
if 00000000 i think that refer to another table which i currently try<br>
<br>
there is another effect u could use<br>
but this time the param in the ieep are important they show the type of target
creature<br>
think param1 = ref to the ids file param2 the ref in the ids file<br>
12=Physical Damage<br>
Param_2 =Damage Bonus<br>
Param_4=Damage Type<br>
Nb Dice Rolled=Nb Dice Rolled<br>
Dice Type= Dice Type<br>
whith the same hex location as in the above example<br>
<br>
Nb don't forget to put 64 (=100%) in (0x2c)<br>

<span class="title">Info for those who make stores...</span>
<hr>
okay, I did some testing the past day or so and found the following information
about Stores:<br>
<br>
first off you can ONLY have a maximum of 4 button choices in a store, and
secondly it seems each type of store can only have certain options and has a
minimum button which is ALWAYS present at that store type. List breakdown for
each game is as follows:<br>
<br>
Baldur's Gate/Tales of the Sword Coast:<br>
Inn - Buy/Sell, Steal, Rooms, Drinks [Rooms minimum]<br>
Store - Buy/Sell, Steal, Identify, Healing [Buy/Sell minimum]<br>
Tavern - Drinks, Buy/Sell, Identify, Steal [Drinks minimum]<br>
Temple - Healing, Donation, Buy/Sell, Identify [Healing, Donation minimum]<br>
<br>
Icewind Dale/Heart of Winter:<br>
Inn - Buy/Sell, Rooms, Drinks [Rooms minimum]<br>
Store - Buy/Sell, Identify, Healing [Buy/Sell minimum]<br>
Tavern - Drinks, Buy/Sell, Identify, [Drinks minimum]<br>
Temple - Healing, Buy/Sell, Identify [Healing minimum]<br>
<br>
Baldur's Gate II Shadows of Amn:<br>
Inn - Buy/Sell, Steal, Rooms, Drinks [Rooms minimum]<br>
Store - Buy/Sell, Steal, Identify, Healing [Buy/Sell minimum]<br>
Tavern - Drinks, Buy/Sell, Identify, Steal [Drinks minimum]<br>
Temple - Healing, Donation, Buy/Sell, Identify [Healing, Donation minimum]<br>
<br>
<br>
and note that in IWD it appears that you can't even STEAL from ANY store as
checking that options is ignored by the game.<br>

<span class="title">New dialog flags identified</span>
<hr>
Each dialog option has 4 bytes of flags. The second least significant byte is
the journal byte (the first sets other options, and the highest 2 seem to be
unused).<br>
<br>
The second LSB works in the following way (tested in BG2 only):<br>
<br>
0x01 -- set this bit to 1 if you want to add a journal. If no other bits are
set, it adds as an &quot;info&quot; journal.<br>
0x02 -- this bit must be 0, else it screws up the dialog?<br>
0x04 -- if this is set in conjunction with bit 1, the journal is added to the
&quot;quests&quot; journal, instead of the info journal.<br>
0x08 -- if this is set in conjunction with bit 1, the journal is removed from
the &quot;quests&quot; journal.

<p>Making new races</p>
<p>CAT</p>
<p>Editing the race selection screen would be hard. The BG executables are HUGE
HUGE HUGE. And even the moderate sized executables I used to edit (yes, I've
done some .EXE editing) were hard to find code in, and they were at most 400 KB
or so of code. At something like 15 to 20 times as large, editing code in the
executables is the needle in the haystack approach, not to mention it being
difficult to edit executable code anyway. Especially static linked stuff like
the Infinity Engine games.<br>
<br>
<br>
If I had the source, I could do it... but reverse engineering something this big
would be titanic in proportions. Even if you identified and removed all the
standard libraries that are linked in there, there's tons of source files worth
of code in that, and if you decompile, you get code sans any identifiers (like
variable names, class names, etc) and sans comments</p>
<p>James Schumacher</p>
<p>that even if you could decompile it successfully (best chance is in assembler)
you could edit the *.exe and recompile it. But we all know the infinity engine
uses DirectX, which in itself is pretty much COM. C/C++ code is hard enough by
itself to manage. When you look at assembler code you'll be even more baffled if
you have no clue what you are looking at. And if you were able to get some
decent complete assembler source (which is pretty easy with a decent decompiler)
you are basically screwed anyway because what Cat said is true. C++ code and
other languages when you look at the code, you know what does what cause the
programmer (if he's smart anyway) will have good naming conventions for his
classes/functions. Add in COM to all this mess and you're just asking for
trouble</p>

<p><font size="5">Mage kits</font></p>
<p>Ok just to start off....this is pretty easy stuff. All you have to do is use
someone elses CLAB file, give it what you want, RENAME it CLABMA08 (for
illusionist) and paste it into the override folder. Look into the kitlist to see
what CLAB each class uses...... Ta Da!!!!<br>
<br>
I couldnt find the regular mage, but i believe the sorcerer is the WILDMAGE (Tee
hee hee) Have fun editing.<br>
<br>
I believe the kitlist is the most important tool for kit editing, now im going
to try to give my sorcerer new weapon skills.<br>
</p>
<p>Ok i made a small mistake. To furthur edit a mage kit, you will be
overwriting an older specialist mage kit.<br>
<br>
Lets take the abjurer from the kitlist2da<br>
22 ABJURER 597 502 9564 CLABMA02 21 0x00000040&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1<br>
<br>
The first number (22) DONT CHANGE IT!<br>
Also dont change the name of the kit ABJURER<br>
The number (597) is the TLK file saying the name of the kit in the mage kit area
(you probably want to change this using the DialogTLK editor to give your kit a
new name)<br>
The number (502) is the TLK file saying the name of the kit appearing on the
character sheet<br>
(same as above to change it)<br>
The number (9564) is the description of the kit (same as above to change it)<br>
The CLABMA02 file is where you will give it its new abilities<br>
The number (21) is for proficiency's (i think you can change that too)<br>
The other number is for unusables<br>
The last number determines which class your kit is in. (DO NOT CHANGE)<br>
<br>
I think all of this should work!<br>
Any comments would be welcome</p>
<p>Ok i have done a little more research and so far i havent been able to change
the info, the name of the kit and the description. I guess the kitlist needs to
be fixed in a way i have not found yet! Im still working on it though. I have a
really cool abjurer that has really cool abilities. Maybe someone else can try?<br>
<br>
Just telling everyone that to edit the monks kit, do the same as above but
rename the file CLABMO01 (CLABlettersMO#01) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
<br>
<br>
I still cant change the info grrrrrrrr!!!<br>
If you've been conscious and reading about kits for the past few weeks, you'll
find out that mage and monk kits cannot be made currently, as mage or monk kits.
Mage kits can't be made at all, but monk kits can be made, but they'd be
fighters.<br>
<br>
First off like you said, there aren't any K_M_*.2da because most likely they are
held in the exe. This might be found out soon, but there is still a good chance
that these kits cannot be made.<br>
<br>
Monk kits can still be made, but they would technically have to be fighter kits.
All you'd have to do is make some new fist items and have them applied to their
quick weapon slot. I haven't been able to get this to work, getting the fist to
attach to the quick weapon slot, it seems that no weapon can be applied with it
working, but on my monk/mage kit (technically a bard kit) he still gets new
fists at specific levels, but they spawn in the inventory and have to be equiped.<br>
<br>
Then for any stats, like hp, ac, and saves, just make them applied abilities in
the CLAB file.<br>
<br>
And also for all you newbies trying to make kits, you can rename and use any
CLAB file what ever you want,but it has to have CLAB then what you want. What
I've done is cleared out the monk's CLAB file and just use that one on all my
kits, and just change it's name for each new kit.<br>
<br>
If you want a detailed tutorial for kit making, visit Drizzt's site.<br>
<br>
And remember for all of you non-kit editing people, never download a kit that
doesn't come with detailed install file</p>

<p><font size="5">Pewne informacje na temat BGMain.EXE</font></p>
<p>Well, I was fiddling around trying to see if I could find where effs are
processed, and came across the following tidbits; some of which might eventually
be useful. I *can* code in assembly, but very slowly and with great personal
pain <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D -->
<img alt=":D" src="../../../www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
 , so I doubt I will pursue many of these much further. All references are from
the disassembly I have; I'm not sure how accurate they are for the file itself;
but they *should* match <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) -->
<img alt=";)" src="../../../www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
 :<br>
<br>
Console commands seem to be processed around 927AD3. I've come across the
following that I haven't seen elsewhere, but I'm not sure if they work:<br>
DisplayText<br>
CreateEngine<br>
StartStore<br>
SetWeather<br>
PlaySound<br>
SetGlobal<br>
GetGlobal<br>
StrrefOn<br>
StrrefOff<br>
SetWaterAlpha<br>
CreateVEFVidCell<br>
AdvanceRealTime<br>
DisplayAllBAMFiles<br>
TestAllDialog<br>
<br>
There are references to BaldurLUA as well; not sure what for.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've counted 20 different EFF types as per the various strings floating around
the exe; does anyone who's spent some time looking at effs know if there are
only 20 unique types in the game? For reference, the types are M35A, M37, M13,
P17, E02, E06, M21, M18a, M31b, M19, M34, P19, M20, M09, M10, P78, P86, P26, P18
and M02, sorted by the position of the code handling them.<br>
<br>
<br>
The file types CHU, WED, ITM, SPL, BCS, IDS, CRE, ARE, GAM, STO, WMP, DLG, 2DA,
CHR, BIO, BS, EFF, VVC, VEF and PRO (geez, I think that's almost all of them!)
are treated together in a block of code around 4362F9. Each calls the code at
9F4916, which is called from no less than 1335 locations. I'm guessing it's a
standard library procedure, but the only disassembler I can get to handle the
file (W32dasm) only recognises Windows dll calls; not standard libary code.</p>

<p><font size="5">dualclass.2da</font></p>
<p>I was able to give the ability to dual class from a monk, sorceror, or
barbarian to another class, but not to those classes. Problem is, only the
barbarian works; monks and sorcerors could dual but would crash as soon as you
hit the skills button in dual class selection. Barbarians work just fine. Just
add this line to the dualclas.2da:<br>
<br>
BARBARIAN 0 1 1 1 1 0<br>
<br>
Don't try to change it so a barbarian can dual to a fighter or ranger as a
barbarian counts as a fighter for some reason. This is why he can
dual...remember, a dual class must also be a viable multiclass; that's why monks
and sorcerers can't dual (there is no fighter/sorcerer multiclass on the
demi-humans selection screen). This may also be the solution. Try and create a
thief/sorcerer multiclass first, then a human swashbuckler to sorcerer dual may
be legal.</p>

<p><font size="5">bounding box</font></p>
<p>The role of bounding box. i have (if i can say) find one. It seem used by the game to place the mouse cursor when using an
exit trigger that required the whole party. </p>
