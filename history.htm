07th September 2003 <br />
Site redesigned, reformatted, updated &amp; streamlined. There are probably a few dead links around the place, these will slowly be cleared up, as the update continues.<br />
<br />
<hr />
<br />
12.07.2002<br />
Finally IESDP came to some updates ;) and also it has been moved back to the place where it was located previously ;) : TeamBG.com . As for updates there are some small clarification added in various sections of the site. Studies and stuff like working caused that I had not enough time to focus on updating IESDP previously.
<br /><br />
20.05.2002<br />
Another small update, mainly by stuff from TBG boards. Effects, some scripting stuff. Unfortunately because of my RL updates are really less frequent than it was in the past. 
<br />
Another news is that IESDP is 1 year old ;)~ . I created it one year ago on the Worldzone server as part of my site about IE editing . Later thanks to many contributors and friends from TBG and other places ... and also nameless contributors ;) IESDP has been growing up ;) gathering more and more data useful for modders ;)
<br />
I think I will still maintain IESDP and discover new stuff when time will allow me ;) and update by stuff discovered by others. 
<br /><br />
28.03.2002<br />
Next update, some contributions in file types ( ARE, ITM, STO for example ) also some small corrections in effects section and in 2DAs ... more things will be updated soon. 
<br /><br />
20.02.2002<br />
Today next update, in mean time I have changed banners and background of the site ... also still have to find time to work on merged version with TeamBG site. For now there are one update in ARE, some updates in Scripting and Effects .
<br /><br />
08.02.2002<br />
The IESDP has been updated again, several less important updates in various sections - effects, 2DAs, some updates in CRE file format.
<br /><br />
04.02.2002<br />
The site has been again updated, new banners made for IESDP and totally new organization of effects section introduced. The IESDP will be also added to TeamBG as one of integral parts of it, but the existing version that may be downloaded will be continued.
<br /><br />
02.02.2002<br />
Finally ! after so long time there has been made next update of IESDP . It seems that new year brought some fresh changes here. and finally some of the not uncovered things were found out like MVE format that will be not described however or some other formats including VAR format, more details about other formats. There will be also changes in site layout - new banners for example.
<br /><br />
25.11.2001<br />
Several new updates. The IESDP will be for now probably established on Brinkster server.
<br /><br />
31.10.2001<br />
Generally site was totally redesigned and really updated by a lot of new info. Problems on IE scene forced me to upload IESDP into another place. 
<br />
Also there are added a lot of new information like numerous tutorials about IE features editing. 
<br /><br />
17.10.2001<br />
Some updates in ARE, WED, TIS formats as well as several changes in 2DAs section, added tutorial how to manage walls attributes using hex editor. Site redesigned again a little, new title added and banner project.
<br /><br />
14.10.2001<br />
KFU format included on TeamBG formats lists with description, I have also redesigned appearance of site.
<br /><br />
13.10.2001<br />
Updated overlays list descriptions.
<br /><br />
12.10.2001<br />
TIS and WED formats updates - significant discoveries on Overlays functioning and doors handling, the rest of WED file verified and some Wall groups information added for clarification.
<br /><br />
11.10.2001<br />

<br /><br />
10.10.2001<br />

<br /><br />
09.10.2001<br />
Verification of WED and update of ARE format.
<br /><br />
21.09.2001<br />
Because of some technical problems with my hardware the 16.09.01 update was never uploaded and now there will be some more new things in this release of IESDP. Today several various updates, I have updated mine tutorial, added Potencius's wallgroups editing description and added several other new data in file formats, 2DA section, scripting, and effects.
<br /><br />
16.09.2001<br />
Minor updates of various sections. My personal involvement in research work will be probably smaller for now (so there will be no more frequent updates - I expect next one either in case of any significant discovery or somewhere in October or November), because of my own work on Add-on for BG2 ToB. That is why I ask for any help to make research for other IE games not described with enough details. 
<br />
There is only possibility that I may publish here parts of my own internal mod notes about various technical aspects of MODs making
<br />
I will be updating IESDP by information posted on IESR unless there are some specific requests to analyze something that I would do myself. 
<br /><br />
06.09.2001<br />
