<div class="fileheader">General Description</div>
<div class="indent1">
This is basically the windows .ini file format. It is focused on storing 
things like quest information and respawn information for areas. Of course 
there are also INI files for general game configuration purposes.<br />
In this section I will disregard the files in IE games responsible for game
configuration and focus on INI files responsible for various actions/features
connected with the game quests themselves.<br />
They could be edited like other INIs - just using simple Wordpad in Windows
or other text editing software.<br />
</div>
<br />

<div class="fileheader">Detailed Description</div>
<div class="indent1">
We have INI files attached to areas responsible for various actions generally
for spawning creatures:<br />
The INI files have the same name as ARE files that are modified by them.<br />
There are the following sections in these files:<br />
<br />
<strong>[locals]</strong><br />
<div class="indent1">
Unknown. Left blank in all example files.<br />
</div>
<br />
<strong>[spawn_main]</strong><br />
<div class="indent1">
Responsible for spawning creatures in area attaches identifiers of next
sections to the certain actions/events.<br />
<strong>enter=name_of_section1</strong><br />
This feature of [spawn_main] assigns the identifier name_of_section1 (of
course one could choose other name , and later use it to make his own section)
to the action of entering area by player.
<br />
<strong>event=name_of_section2</strong><br />
This feature of [spawn_main] assigns the identifier name_of_section2 (of
course one could choose other name , and later use it to make his own section)
to the action in general. It means that the appearance of this effect may be
controlled either by variable identifier (if included in spawned creatures
definitions) or by timer that is set in description of assigned
identifier.<br />
Later file contains of the identifiers definitions that were assigned in [spawn_main]
section. According to our example (one could always make more references in [spawn_main]
section, thus definitions later in INI ) we will consider identifiers named
name_of_section1 and name_of_section2.<br />
</div>
<br />
<strong>[name_of_section1]</strong><br />
<div class="indent1">
Section starts by its identifier<br />
<strong>critters= cre1,cre2,.........(or other suitable identifiers)</strong><br />
This assigns spawned creatures identifiers to the [name_of_section1] section.
Creatures identifiers will be used later as the names of appropriate sections
names.<br />
<strong>interval= integer number</strong><br />
Time interval before creatures from [name_of_section1] will be spawned. Time
is counted in relation 1 minute (of real or game time ?) = 900.<br />
The similar definition is given in case of [name_of_section2] or other
sections defined by user in [spawn_main] section.<br />
At last spawned creatures identifier definitions. Let's take name from
example - cre1.<br />
</div>
<br />
<strong>[cre1]</strong><br />
<div class="indent1">
Name of identifier used in&nbsp; previous events definitions is the name of
section.<br />
Then there are several options:<br />
<span class="unknown">spec = [xxx.yyy.zzz.vvv.qqq]</span><br />
<span class="unknown">xxx, yyy, zzz, vvv, qqq - integer numbers&nbsp; - I
have no idea what do they mean</span><br />
<span class="unknown">spec_qty = integer number&nbsp;</span><br />
<span class="unknown">some number,&nbsp; I have seen only value 1, usage unknown,</span><br />
<strong>spec_var = name_of_variable</strong><br />
Name_of_variable is just global variable that may be used in area script to
trigger the event occurrence (spawning creatures). <font color="#000099">I have
no idea if it works only if variable is not zero or it have to be set to 1 ?</font><br />
<strong>cre_file = CRE_file_name</strong><br />
File name of CRE file without extension that is used for spawned creatures.<br />
<strong>Script_default = script_name.</strong><br />
Sets the default script for spawned creature named script_name (remember to
put names without extension). The BCS file.<br />
<strong><font color="#000099">ai_specifics = integer number</font></strong><br />
<font color="#000099">usage unknown, uses values assigned by SPECIFIC.IDS</font><br />
<strong>spawn_point = [xxxx.yyyy:z]</strong><br />
xxxx - is x position on the area<br />
yyyy - is y position on the area<br />
z - is the face direction of spawned creature.<br />
