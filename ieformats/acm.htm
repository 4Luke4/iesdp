The ACM format is a properity copyrighted format, used by Interplay.<br />
In the IE games, ACM files are used for ambients, area music and game shell music. The ACM files in the game are located in the \music folder, under the parent game directory.<br />
Each ambient is stored under its own subfolder. For example, the ambient of area 1 could be stored under music\AR1, while another ambient for area 2 could be under music/AR2.<br />
The ACM files under the subdirectories are named according to this:<br />
<div class="indent1">Subdirectory Name+File Tag+Number (optional)</div>
For example, the files under the BC1 can be BC1A1 or BC1ZA.<br />
Music is usually made up of multiple files, as opposed to 1 larger file. This ensures that the music has a smooth progression when conditions change (ie. end of combat, end of ambient sound), rather than a sharp interuption. This smooth progression is done via MUS files, which act as ACM playlists. All MUS files are in the \music folder, and are attached to areas or romances through 2da files.<br />

Programs to convert to and from ACM files can be found at the Russian Fallout editing page:

ACM files can be in varying qualities, but the common one is 22050 Hz, 16 bits and stereo.<br />
<br />
NB. The IE plays ACM files at twice the speed of the original WAV file.<br />
