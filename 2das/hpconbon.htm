<p>This file defines constitution influence on the creature.</p>
<p>First column is the value of NPCs constitution</p>
<p>2nd column is the HP bonus for all classes except warriors</p>
<p>3rd the same as above for warriors</p>
<p>4th It refers to the minimum possible roll for Hit Points before<br>
the bonus is applied. For all human or related characters, this is a 1<br>
(core-rules), but for giants, dragons, etc, it could be as high as 4, as<br>
the chart shows. Normal and Easy difficulties ignore this Min_Roll column<br>
as they grant the maximum possible roll for the class involved, plus any<br>
bonus.<br>
<br>
In other words, if I'm a human fighter with an 18 CON, I can roll any value<br>
from 1 (Min_Roll) to 10 and then add my bonus. But if I'm a dragon with 25<br>
CON, I can roll any value from 4 (Min_Roll) to whatever a dragon's max roll<br>
is and then any bonus that may be available. With Easy and Normal<br>
difficulties, the fighter would always roll a 10 + bonus, ignoring the<br>
Min_Roll value.<br>
</p>
<p>5th as name states , the rate of regeneration modifier&nbsp;</p>
<p>6th fatigue bonus for constitution&nbsp;</p>
<p>In BG2 ToB we have :</p>
