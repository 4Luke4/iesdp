<p>2DA files are used for various things like kits making, setting game rules
and other things like ARE, CRE files modifications, contents of
&quot;random&quot; treasures in game - using them we could override many things
that actually require much more complicated editing. This format is very easy,
text format that could be modified even in the Windows Notepad, thus even
newbies could easily make new kits for example for BG2 SoA or ToB. </p>
