<p><font size="5">(as well as other files for NPCs - at least these which have
been linked to this description)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>This file defines the portrait of the NPC that will appear at&nbsp; the end
of game and also text that will be displayed -&nbsp; .</p>
<p>second line of file here : in our example *NJAHEIRL is just the reference to
the BMP file containing of the large portrait of NPC.</p>
<p>Later we have in the first column classes and races identifiers. the first
and second column contain of references to dialog.tlk for displayed texts, so
one can make different endings for different PCs.</p>
<p>Also, one could make more endings for NPCs just by making more 2DA files like
this and using scripting commands , for example TextScreen(&quot;JAHEIND2&quot;)
- this will use resources indicated in this 2DA file.</p>
