<p>This file defines names of states (like death, poisoned etc....) that are
shown in the game message window.</p>
<p>The first column consists of number of the effect, tested it with some
effects like slow (40) and Charm Specific Creature (5) and others.</p>
<p>Second column is as it is said - the effect description without effect on
game - just for information.</p>
<p>Third column consists of the strref with the name of this effect that is
shown in game.</p>
<p>In BG2 ToB we have :</p>
<pre>2DA V1.0
-1
     EFFECT_NAME        STRREF
25     POISON           14017
13     DEATH            14026
134    PETRIFICATION    14127
12     DAMAGE           14027
39     SLEEP            20438
68     UNSUMMON         14065

<p>Thx to To_An for clarifications.</p>
