<p align="center"><font size="5">Variables types description by David Gaider</font></p>
<p>You can give a global/variable any name you like, but make sure it does not
match and therefore replace another global that is in use.<br>
<br>
There are three types of globals / variables :<br>
<br>
GLOBAL: SetGlobal(&quot;XXXXXX&quot;,&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,1)<br>
The above command sets the XXXXXX global to 1, and this global can be seen by
any other script in the game once it is set. &nbsp;Another creature script can
see it and call on it, as can an area script, dialogue script, whichever.<br>
A common use of this in dialogue is when an NPC has given the player a piece of
information that is used in other scripts elsewhere...the game as a whole must
know that this information has been given, so the variable is set as a global.<br>
<br>
LOCALS: SetGlobal(&quot;XXXXXX&quot;,&quot;LOCALS&quot;,1)<br>
The above command sets the XXXXXX global to 1...but it is local only to the
creature it is set for. &nbsp;If you set a local variable for an NPC, then only
that NPC can check later to see what their local is. &nbsp;Other scripts cannot
see local variables that are not their own. &nbsp;The benefit to using a Local
is that the global can be the same name as locals being used by other
creatures...it does not matter if they have the same name, so long as the
creature, itself, isn't duplicating its own locals.<br>
A common use of this in dialogue is to mark off dialogues that are only supposed
to be said once. &nbsp;The dialogue checks to see if the variable is 0 and then
starts the dialogue...and in its first link sets that variable to 1. &nbsp;The
romance NPC's also use local variables to track their 'LoveTalk' setting...this
tells the NPC which dialogue they should currently be giving to the player.<br>
<br>
AREA: SetGlobal(&quot;XXXXXX&quot;,&quot;AR0500&quot;,1)<br>
The above command sets the XXXXXX global to 1...but only for area 0500. &nbsp;This
is used mainly in area scripts...or in other scripts where you are positive that
it will only occur in that area. &nbsp;Other scripts can see this variable the
same as a global...but different areas can use the same name for the area global
and not supercede each other.<br>
Area scripts are not used often in dialogue unless the scripter is sure that it
will only occur in a specific area.</p>
