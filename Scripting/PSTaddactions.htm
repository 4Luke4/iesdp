<p align="center"><font size="5">New Additional actions for Planescape : Torment</font></p>
<p>by LordRampage and Platter.</p>
<p>Simply copy and paste these three into your ACTION.IDS file using
NearInfinity.&nbsp; If you don't have NearInfinity, or your computer cannot run
java scripts, use Infinity Explorer, load up PS:T, export the ACTION.IDS file to
your desktop, open it up with notepad, cut &amp; paste, then save the file and
move it to your PS:T override folder.<br>
<br>
The commands:<br>
<br>
<b>170 RevealAreaOnMap(S:ResRef*)<br>
173 AddJournalEntry(I:Entry*)<br>
176 EscapeAreaDestroy(I:Delay*)<br>
</b><b>182 MakeUnselectable(I:Time*)<br>
188 TakePartyItemAll(S:Item*)</b><br>
<b>190 FinalSave()</b></p>
<p><br>
They work exactly like their Baldur's Gate conterparts. For those that don't
know what they do:<br>
<br>
<b>RevealAreaOnMap </b>shows a place on the map using the map entry's
refferrence number.<br>
Ex: RevealAreaOnMap(&quot;AR1200&quot;) shows the Fortress of Regrets on your
map.<br>
<br>
<b>AddJournalEntry</b> adds an entry based upon the string used.<br>
Ex: AddJournalEntry(47938) adds the text &quot;Leave&quot; to your journal as an
entry.<br>
<br>
<b>EscapeAreaDestroy </b>is a variant of EscapeArea. That's all I know.<br>
<br>
<b>MakeUnselectable(I:Time*)</b> makes the party member unselectable for the
specified amount of time.</p>
<p><b>TakePartyItemAll(S:Item*)</b> takes all of the specified item (ex- even if
you have more than one) from your party and gives them to the creature
performing the action.</p>
<p><b>FinalSave</b> makes a saved game file called &quot;Final Save&quot;.&nbsp;
Perfect for final battles.&nbsp; It also exports The Nameless One as a CHR file
to a folder called &quot;Characters&quot;, but that's the only side affect.</p>
