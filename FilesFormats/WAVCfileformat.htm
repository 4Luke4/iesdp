<p>Unlike ACM files, they can be put in the override folder, or BIF files. All
WAVC files are 22050 Hz, 16 bits and mono.<br>
Since the game only recognizes files with WAV extensions, they must be renamed
to *.WAV before being used in the game.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Wavc</b> is the sounds file format used in IE games. Actually it is an acm
file with the additional header attached.<br>
It has the following header :<br>

<p>In aim to make Wac &nbsp;file we need the following utilities :<br>
snd2acm.exe<br>
acm2wav.exe<br>
wavc.exe<br>
<br>
I suppose that you could find these utilities on Potencius page or you could try
on Russian Fallout customization sites (Fallout engine also uses acm format, so
these guys have all needed utilities)</p>
<p><a href="http://potenciusnet.teambg.net/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF">http://potenciusnet.teambg.net/</font></a><font color="#FF0000"><br>
<br>
</font><a href="http://www.fallout.ru/teamx/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF">http://www.fallout.ru/teamx/</font></a><font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font><br>
<br>
Firstly we have to increase the speed of chosen wav sound by 100% (all wac
sounds have increased speed)<br>
Then we have to compress it using snd2acm to acm file (in the same time we note
somewhere the output file size - this is our compressed acm file size)<br>
Then we decompress it again using acm2wav in aim to determine the decompressed
file size (amount of written bytes).<br>
<br>
When we have these two numbers we can edit our acm file in hex editor : we add
the header as described above and translate compressed and decompressed sizes to
hexadecimal numbers and enter it as indicated in header description.<br>
We can check if our file is valid using wavc converter - if the output is the
same as source wav file then we have succeeded.<br>
<br>
Then if you want to use these files in IE game you have to change extension of
your wavc file to wav and put into override. and voila ! we have wavc compressed
files.<br>
Make sound reference in <a href="TLKformat.htm"><font color="#FF0000"> dialog.tlk</font></a> if your wavc file serves as dialogue / speech
sound.</p>
