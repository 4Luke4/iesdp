<h2>Description</h2>
<p>SRC files contain Strrefs for things which are spoken by characters in
Planescape: Torment outside of normal dialog. (i.e. on the main overhead
screen). I believe these are triggered by scripts, usually, since some of these
things are not spoken all the times. The ones which are spoken are typically
spoken cyclically. (i.e. each one is spoken in turn with a delay in between). An
example of this is the puzzled skeleton in the Dead Nations. Another, slightly
different example, is Morte's taunts, which are stored in this type of file. If
the strref has an associated string, the string usually appears over the head of
the character who is speaking. If the strref has an associated sound, it is
played when the line is spoken. The associated strings are not always spoken,
however; in the case of Morte's taunts, the sound is played, but the associated
text (&quot;Morte's Taunts 1&quot; ... &quot;Morte's Taunts 23&quot;) is not.</p>
<h2>SRC files: Planescape: Torment</h2>
<p>A SRC file has as it's header the number of entries. Each entry is eight
bytes and consists of a Strref and an undetermined dword, whose value is 1 in
all available files.</p>
