<p>The ACM files, a copyrighted properity of Interplay, are used for ambients,
area music and game shell music. All the ACM files in the game are located in
the /music folder, under the parent game directory.<br>
Each ambient is stored under its own subfolder. For example, the ambient of area
1 could be stored under music/AR1, while another ambient for area 2 could be
under music/AR2.<br>
The ACM files under the subdirectories are named according to this:<br>
Subdirectory Name+File Tag+Number (optional)<br>
For example, the files under the BC1 can be BC1A1 or BC1ZA.<br>
Mostly, the music is not in a single ACM file, but rather in multiple files.
This is to ensure, when the music is interrupted (end of combat, or start of
combat and end of area ambient), it won't come cut off abruptly, but end with
another file which ends slowly and gives a &quot;fading&quot; effect.<br>
This operation is done through the MUS files, which act as ACM playlists. All
MUS files are in the /music folder, and are attached to areas or romances
through a certain 2da file. This file can vary from game to game.<br>
Since ACM format is guarded somewhat fiercely by Interplay, it cannot be
documented. However, there are from and to ACM converters, snd2acm and acm2wav.
They can be found on the TeamX site (<a href="http://www.fallout.ru/teamx" target="_blank">www.fallout.ru/teamx</a>).
Infinity Sound Converter acts as a windows front-end for these converters.<br>
ACM files can be in varying qualities, but the common one is 22050 Hz, 16 bits
and stereo.<br>
The games play ACM files at double-speed, so you must slow your WAV files before
converting to ACM.<br>
