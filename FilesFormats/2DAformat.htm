<h2>Description</h2>
<p>2DA (or &quot;2-Dimensional Array&quot;) files contain a two-dimensional
array of data. It used to represent many forms of tabular data, for instance the
2nd edition D&amp;D rules. Other data, including the experience cap, kits
descriptions in BG2 SoA and ToB and so on... is stored this format of file, as
well.</p>
<h2>2DA files: Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, BG2 SoA/ToB</h2>
<p>2DA files are text files. If the first two bytes are 0xff, the file is
encrypted. Otherwise, the entire file is plaintext. All fields in the file are white space
separated. As a result, the fields cannot contain spaces. The first row has the
signature, &quot;2DA V1.0&quot;, which may be preceded by white space. The
second row has the &quot;default value&quot;. The next row has column-headings.
Following rows consist of first a row heading, then the row data. There cannot
be more row data in any row than there are column headings, but if there are
fewer, the values which are not filled in are assumed to have the default value
from the second line of the file. A sample file appears below.</p>
<pre>2DA V1.0
1234
        NAME    VALUE   WEIGHT
A       alpha
B
C       beta    2345    123
</pre>
<p>In the above example, row A has the values <code>{ alpha, 1234, 1234 }</code>.
Row B has the values <code>{ 1234, 1234, 1234 }</code>. Row C has the values <code>{
beta, 2345, 123 }</code>. The only important thing to remember is that alignment
counts for nothing. The only thing that counts for anything is the ordinal index
of the field within the line.</p>
<h2>Encryption</h2>
<p>Note that some of these files are encrypted, as are some of the <a href="IDSformat.htm"><font color="#FF0000"> IDS
files</font></a>.
(The encryption appears to only occur in BG, and not in PS: Torment. Anyway, to
read about the technical details of the encryption, go to the <a href="../General/encryption.htm"><font color="#FF0000">encryption
page</font></a>.)</p>
